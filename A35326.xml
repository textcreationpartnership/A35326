            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THeſe Sermons are ſome of the Reliques of one who is gone to receive the Fruit of his Labours, who hath left Sowing for the ſake of the Harvest, wherein he is now reaping. Though this is a</hi> Poſthumous <hi>Piece, yet it ſpeaks out the living Praiſe of the dead Author, whoſe it was without any Alteration or Addition, being Printed from his own Notes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If I may uſe the Phraſe in Faſhion, he lived too fast; not as too many do, who ſhorten their Days by their Debaucheries, and ſinful Exceſſes, but as a Taper which waſtes it ſelf to give Light to others. His Bodily Conſtitution was too weak to undergo the Service his Soul put it to, in conſtant Studies and hard Labour, that he might Anſwer the Reſtleſneſs of his Mind, which was always aſpiring to greater Knowledge and higher Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby he laid greater load upon his Fleſh than its weakneſs could bear, and ſo ſinking under the burden, he died in the midst of his Days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no need of my Epiſtle to Midwife theſe Excellent Diſcourſes into the World, nor had I had any hand in it, had it not been to anſwer the Deſires of ſome Relations of his, to whom my Obligations will not allow me to deny any
<pb facs="tcp:41523:3"/>thing; And alſo to take this occaſion to Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate what I ſpake and publiſhed in his Funeral Sermon about the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Spirit of Chriſt with the Dead Body of a Saint, which hath by ſome been greatly stumbled at, and called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion as a new Doctrine, I therefore thought it Charity to ſuch to remove this stumbling Block, not by any Arguments. further than what I have therein already urged, but by calling in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others in this matter, and I ſhall look no farther back, than to the Learned Men of our own Times.</hi>

               <hi>ſays,</hi> Not only in Death, but even after Death this Union holds; the Saints are ſaid <hi>to ſleep in Jeſus;</hi> that part of the Saints which is capable of ſleep, is not capable of Separation from Chriſt: While their more noble Part is united to Chriſt in Heaven, <hi>among the Spirits of Just Men made perfect;</hi> Chriſt is united to their inferiour, and more

The Spirit of God did dwell in the Body of Chriſt in the Grave, and raiſed it up, he never left him. Though his Body was a dead Carkaſs without a Soul, yet that Body was <hi>Hypoſtatically</hi> united to the Godhead, therefore it was called <hi>Holy One; My Holy One ſhall not ſee Corruption.</hi> Now the Compariſon is, If we have the Spirit of Chriſt, and if he dwell in us, the ſame Spirit ſhall never leave our Bodies till he hath raiſed us up alſo.

Now then, if our Head riſe, all the Members muſt riſe with it; if the Head be in Heaven, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhall not for ever periſh in the Grave. This Union by the Spirit is like the touch of a <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> it will attract and draw us to him, that <hi>where he is, we ſhall be alſo.</hi> It is ſpoken of his <hi>Hypoſtatical,</hi> but it is true alſo of his <hi>Myſtical</hi> Union, <hi>Quod ſemel aſſumpſit nunquam depoſuit.</hi> Chriſt will part with none of his Members.<note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Brownrig,</hi> 2d Vol. p. <hi>204.</hi>

               <hi>And again in the ſame Page.</hi> Our Bodies by this Inhabitation are Conſecrated to be a Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and the Temple of God muſt not be deſtroy'd. — God's Spirit takes Pleaſure not only in theſe living Temples, but owns them when they are dead; takes Pleaſure

            <p>
               <hi>I could multiply Teſtimonies of elder Date, to prove the Truth of this Doctrine, and that it is no new Notion; but there needs no Proof from Humane Teſtimony, when it is ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed by the Word of God, as I have elſewhere ſhewed.</hi> If we receive the Witneſs of Men, the Witneſs of God is greater. <hi>And there needs no greater Vindication of any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, than the Teſtimony of God to the truth of it.</hi>

               <hi>The Author of theſe Diſcourſes was a Perſon whoſe Worth was well known in this City; he was a Perſon of a ſound Mind and Judgment in the great Doctrines of the Goſpel, and</hi> held faſt the Form of ſound Words, <hi>carefully ſhunning the Paths of thoſe</hi> By-way <hi>Men, who pleaſe themſelves with the fond Thoughts of ſuch Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, wherein they chuſe to walk by themſelves apart from the Community of the Saints, and Churches of God.</hi>

               </epigraph>
               <p>TO underſtand the occaſion of theſe Words, we muſt look back as far as <hi>ver.</hi> 13. of this Chapter, where our Lord, having a mind to clear and confirm his Diſciples in the Knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, makes way for it, by the propoſing of ſuch Queſtions, as would draw forth ſuitable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. Accordingly</p>
               <p n="1">1. He asks them, what was the Opinion of others concerning him. <hi>Whom do Men ſay, that I the Son of Man am?</hi> Chriſt uſually ſtiled himſelf thus, <hi>Son of Man,</hi> not only as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his Humility, but to ſhew that he was the promiſed Seed, the Perſon foretold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Character in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4.80.17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13. And perhaps alſo to try the Faith of his Hearers, whether they had an Eye to any more than his Humanity; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41523:7"/>ſays he here, what does that World which you Converſe with, think of me, what kind of Perſon do they take me to be? The Anſwer is, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Some ſay, that thou art John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, ſome Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the Prophets.</hi> Here was a diverſity of Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Chriſt, and none of them right, but all falſe and fabulous, the Products of vain Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>That Chriſt was John the Baptiſt, riſen from the Dead,</hi> was <hi>Herods</hi> Opinion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.2. That he was <hi>Elias,</hi> was the Opinion of many among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had a miſtaken Notion that <hi>Elias</hi> muſt firſt come before the Appearance of Chriſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.10. And again another ſort of them thought, that he was the Soul of ſome eminent Deceaſed Prophet in a new Body; which was one of the wild Conceits of that dark, erroneous Age.</p>
               <p>But 2. Chriſt asks them, what was their own Opinion? <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Whom ſay ye, that I am?</hi> Do you concur with this blind and ignorant World, or have you any better Apprehenſions of me different from theirs? 'Tis meet, that you who are my little Flock, ſhould give me ſome account of your particular Belief; and 'tis alſo meet, that ſeeing you are to Preach me unto others, you ſhould firſt make ſome Confeſſion of me your ſelves. The Anſwer to this, and the Perſon anſwering, we have <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Which, becauſe it hath an immediate Coherence with the Words now before us, ought to be diſtinctly conſider'd. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may begin with the leſs conſiderable Part, the Perſon ſpeaking, <hi>[Simon Peter anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid.]</hi> 'Tis probable, that he ſpake as the Mouth of the Apoſtles, in the Name of all,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41523:7"/>and that the reſt agreed to this Teſtimony, and believ'd as he ſaid. Not that he had any real Precedency, or Superiority above the reſt (for then, why ſhould they enquire, who was the greateſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chap. 18.1.) but becauſe he was one of the firſt call'd to the Apoſtleſhip, and of the more eſteem among them, as he was of ſo long a ſtanding; and becauſe he was of a very warm and forward Spirit, as is evident by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Paſſages.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is the Thing ſpoken, which is the main Subject of our Conſideration. <hi>[Thou art Chriſt the Son of the Living God.]</hi> The ſame good Confeſſion was made once before by <hi>Peter, John</hi> 6.69. And now repeated, to evidence his firm Eſtabliſhment in this grand Article of Faith. In which our Lord is deſcrib'd two Ways, both by his Office, and his Eſſence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt is a Name of Office, of the ſame Signification with the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as the Holy Ghoſt himſelf Interprets it. <hi>John</hi> 1.41. <hi>The anointed of the Lord;</hi> he to whom the Prophets witneſs't, he that ſhould come into the World; as <hi>John</hi> 11.27. He whoſe Work and Buſineſs was to be a Saviour, not a Temporal, but an Eternal one, a Saviour from Sin and Wrath, from the drudgery of the Devil, and the Priſon of Hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Son of God is a Name, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects his Eſſence and Being; a Son, not by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption and Grace, as the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and the other Prophets were, but a Son by Nature; a Son whoſe Generation is ineffable, for he is infinitely Equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for he is true God, as well as Son of God; the Father hath that Title of the Living God, in Oppoſition to falſe Gods, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.10.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41523:8"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 14.15. And the very ſame Title is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe given to the Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. Jeſus is true Jehovah, and (according to the true Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that Word) he hath Life in himſelf, as the Father hath, <hi>John</hi> 5.26. Well; Chriſt's Commendation of this Confeſſion, is ſet down in the Text, <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him,</hi> &amp;c. Where we may take Notice of three Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Name which Chriſt calls this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle by. <hi>Simon Bar-jonai,</hi> or <hi>Simon, Son of</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, as the Word ſignifies. <hi>Peter</hi> was the Name that Chriſt gave to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. As God gave the Name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.28. But here Chriſt puts him in Mind of the meanneſs of his Extraction, and of what he was original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as he does again after his fall, no leſs than three Times over, <hi>John</hi> 21.15, 16, 17 What change ſoever is made upon us by the Favour and Mercy of God, 'tis good to reflect ſometimes upon our Primitive Vileneſs and Wretchedneſs, to look to the Rock whence we are hewen, and the hole of the Pit, whence we are digged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Happy State which Chriſt pronounc't him to be in. <hi>Bleſſed art thou.</hi> Chriſt had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to pronounce Perſons bleſſed, for he had Power to make them ſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. <hi>God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you.</hi> He can really and effectually do it; what <hi>Palak</hi> ſaid falſly of <hi>Balaam,</hi> is true of Chriſt, <hi>The Man whom he bleſſes, is bleſſed</hi> (<hi>Numb.</hi> 22.6.) If he bleſſes, we ſhall be bleſſed for ever, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.27. Such is the Bleſſedneſs which Chriſt ſpeaks of here; both Perfect and Perpetual, without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and without Decay.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Reaſon aſſign'd to back this comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41523:8"/>Sentence, which refers to the Way and Means of the diſcovery of that Truth which <hi>Peter</hi> had now confeſt; and this is laid down both Negatively and Affirmatively.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Negatively, <hi>For Fleſh and Blood hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it unto Thee.</hi> Fleſh and Blood are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly taken in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes for the humane Nature, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of Soul and Body; ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes for the natural Body, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with its preſent Infirmities, in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a ſpiritual glorified Body. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes for humane Inſtruction, ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>that he conferred not with Fleſh and Blood,</hi> which is the ſame Thing, with not receiving the Goſpel which he Preacht, of Man, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes for humane Oppoſition, ſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. <hi>We wreſtle not with Fleſh and Blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> we have not only to do with perſecuting Men, but raging Devils.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Sometimes for natural Reaſon; our own Judgments and Underſtanding. And this I take to be the principal Senſe of the Phraſe here; <hi>q. d.</hi> Thou doſt not owe this Revelation to thy ſelf, or to any diſcerning Faculty in thee above other Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Affirmatively, <hi>But my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Four Things ſeem to be intimated by this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is a myſterious Order in all Divine Operations, according to which God the Father is to be lookt upon as the Fountain. The Father Works, and the Son and Spirit Works conjunctly; there is no Inequality or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41523:9"/>Subordination among the Perſons, and yet we are led by the Goſpel to Eye the firſt Perſon as the ſpring of all. When our Lord ſpeaks of ſending the Comforter, 'tis from the Father, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. And when the Spirit of the Son is ſent forth into our Hearts, God is ſaid to do it, which is plainly meant of God the Father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in all the Works of Grace towards loſt Creatures, God acts as the Father of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings in him.</hi> Out of Chriſt we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect only the Curſe of God, as a revenging Judge, but we can expect nothing from him as a Father, in a way of Love and Mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Acquaintance with the only begotten Son of God muſt flow from him that begat him. <hi>No Man knoweth the Son, but the Father, as no Man knoweth the Father but the Son,</hi> Mat. 11.27. Therefore they mutually manifeſt and declare each other, which none elſe is capable of doing. Who ſhould lay open the Secrets of one Man to another, but himſelf? And who ſhould reveal the glorious Perſons in the Godhead, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If therefore we look for Light, we muſt look upwards. As the Sun over our Heads is the viſible Cauſe of natural Illumination, ſo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Illumination is from an Infinite Being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Sun. 'Tis one of the gracious Iſſues which belong to our Father in Heaven. The dark Places of the Earth, unanimouſly ſay, it is not in us. <hi>Every good and perfect Gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights.</hi> James 1.17. The Words thus open'd, come to this Point.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41523:9"/>
               <p>Obſ. <hi>There is a certain Bleſſedneſs annext to the Knowledge of thoſe Truths, which humane Reaſon does not diſcover, but God himſelf.</hi> Here
<list>
                     <item>1. Shew, That there are ſome Truths neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believ'd, which humane Reaſon nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does nor can diſcover.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew, That there are ſome Truths ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believ'd, which humane Reaſon cannot diſcover. The peculiar Doctrines of the Goſpel are as deep, as the Commands of the Law are broad. But I will confine my ſelf to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance mention'd in the Context, the Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt. Every one is bound to believe this, and every Man that calls himſelf a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, profeſſes the Belief of it; without ſuch a Profeſſion, his Chriſtianity is void, and without ſuch a Belief, his Profeſſion is vain. To take upon us the Chriſtian Name, and deny the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, is a lying to Men, and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acknowledgment of this, where there is not an Hearty Conſent, is lying to God. Now that this is not diſcoverable by humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is no difficult Matter to prove. Let us conſider a little theſe two Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reaſon could never have found out this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41523:10"/>Truth, of the Godhead of Chriſt. The Exiſtence of a God is a natural Impreſſion upon the Minds of Men, and therefore almoſt univerſally own'd; but a Trinity of Perſons in Unity of Eſſence, and ſuch an Order among the Perſons, as makes Jeſus Chriſt the Second determinately, not the Firſt or Third, is one of the great Myſteries of Faith. By thoſe common remainders of Light, which every Man hath, that comes into the World, every Age hath brought forth ſome new Inventions and Diſcoveries of Things that have been truly ingenious and uſeful in their kind, but ſtill they have been Things within the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Compaſs and ſphaere of Nature. Jeſus Chriſt would have been for ever the unknown God, if Reaſon had been left to make the ſearch. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How many parts of the World are there, utterly deſtitute of the Knowledge of this Truth! Though the Nations of them that are ſaved walk in the Light of it, yet there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Nations of Men that have natural Sagacity enough, who ſit in groſs Darkneſs as to theſe Things. Multitudes, Multitudes, in the Wilderneſs of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> whom God hath not yet brought into the Valley of Viſion, that never heard whether there be a Chriſt or no. He that ſhould tell the uncalled <hi>Gentiles</hi> of ſuch a Perſon, would be a <hi>Barbarian</hi> to them, though he had learnt to ſpeak in their own Tongue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Notions of ſome of the Learned <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> which look a little this way, were both borrow'd and deprav'd. What was true in them, was not their own, but learnt by Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were inſtructed out of the Law; all the reſt was wretchedly corrupt, and diſhonourable to Chriſt, and injurious to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41523:10"/>Religion. Therefore the Apoſtle gives that Caution, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Beware leſt any Man ſpoil you through Philoſophy and vain Deceit,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore he paſſes that Cenſure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they become Fools.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe Signatures and Prints of this Truth which ſome fancy to be upon the viſible Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are too obſcure to Collect ſo great a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from. There may be ſome little dim re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of a Trinity in ſome of the Works of God, but as they are too weak to confirm our Faith of it by, ſo we may ſafely conclude, that no Man in the World, would ever have ſpelt a Trinity out of them, if he had not heard of it before. <hi>But as Knowledge is eaſie to him that underſtandeth,</hi> Prov. 14 6. So we fancy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Evidences of thoſe Things, of which we are convinc'd already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reaſon cannot find out this Truth to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, though the Scripture hath brought it to Light; now it is reveal'd to us another Way, Reaſon is puzzled with it. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Things of an Infinite Nature muſt needs be Eternal Riddles to Finites Minds God would not be God, if Men or Angels could comprehend him; he muſt ceaſe to be what he is, if we could fully know what he is. Uncreated Excellency and Glory cannot be taken in to ſuch ſhallow and ſcanty Thoughts. We can underſtand the Relation which is between Creatures like our ſelves, we can explain it, and give a ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Account of it one to another; but how the Divine Perſons, our Everlaſting Creators (as the Spirit ſometimes expreſſes it) are mutually related, is not to be perfectly unfolded. How the ſame Perſon ſhould be Man and yet God,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41523:11"/>how the ſame God ſhould be a Son, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver begin to be, will be matter of endleſs Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reaſon Objects ſo many Difficulties againſt this Truth, of the Sonſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, as make us very ſlow in receiving it. The manner of it is ſo inexplicable, that therefore the thing it ſelf ſeems to be incredible; for naturally we affect to be ſatisfied how every thing is, which we allow to be. The carnal Mind is Enmity in this Caſe, and inſtead of promoting, oppoſes, therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks of caſting down Imaginations, or Reaſonings (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. As there is a natural <hi>Popery,</hi> ſo a natural <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> which exalts it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God and Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Faith of theſe Things which is wrought in us, is not built upon the Evidence of Reaſon, but the Authority of God. There is indeed a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Faith; it is reaſonable that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve whatſoever God reveals, and 'tis reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we ſhould be aſſur'd, that this or that is his Revelation; ſo far Reaſon is ſubſervient to Faith in the general; but to believe a particular Truth becauſe it may be retionally demonſtrated, is not the Faith of the Goſpel; we are to believe, becauſe it is Divinely Revealed; this is Faith. Otherwiſe in believing, we do not ſet our Seal to the Truth of God, but the Reaſon of the Thing. So that if it were poſſible to bring other Proofs as well as Scriptural of the Deity of our Lord Jeſus (which it is not, for it is a Matter of pure Revelation) yet the Faith of a Chriſtian, as ſuch, could not reſt upon them.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41523:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. How are ſuch Truths as theſe diſcovered to us by God. In ſhort, it is the ſpecial Work of the Spirit to reveal Chriſt to us, to direct our Minds into the Knowledge of his Perſon, and to take of his Things and to ſpread them before us with convincing Light. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Things which God hath prepared,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit, for the Spirit ſearcheth all Things,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10. But as to the Way and Manner of this Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Things by the Spirit of God, I would offer theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not in the neglect and diſuſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means. God will not countenance our Contempt of what is required and appointed by himſelf. He hath commanded us privately to ſearch the Scriptures which teſtifie of Chriſt, and to attend the Publick Preaching of Chriſt in Worſhipping Aſſemblies; and ſo in and by the Word, as a fit vehicle of ſpiritual Light, he is pleas'd to convey the Knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of his Son. The Scriptures and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances cannot enlighten us without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ordinarily the Spirit does it not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, Miniſters are ſtiled Inſtructors in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. And they are ſo by Vertue of the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt imploys and make uſe of them to ſerve the Purpoſes and Ends of his own Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Does not the Holy Ghoſt ſay, <hi>They ſhall not teach every Man his Neighbour, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, Know the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.11. <hi>And you need not that any Man teach you,</hi> 1 John 2.27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. 'Tis moſt evident, that theſe Places
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41523:12"/>do not intend the advancing of immediate Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, in defiance to inſtituted Means; the teaching of God are not to be oppos'd to the teachings of Men; for even in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the teachings of Men are often mention'd as ſubordinate to the teachings of God. <hi>He that heareth you,</hi> ſays Chriſt to his Apoſtles, <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me,</hi> Luke 10.16. <hi>And though Men are Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors for Chriſt, it is as though God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you by them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſence of theſe Places therefore muſt be, that the Effuſion of the Spirit under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel would be ſo plentiful, not as to exclude humane Teaching, or render it unneceſſary, but ſo as vaſtly to exceed and out-do it, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon it ſhould be as no Teaching; for Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that are taught of God, though they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe not external Miniſtrations, yet may ſay to their Miniſters, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>John</hi> 4.42. <hi>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have heard him our ſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though it be in the uſe of outward Means, yet 'tis an internal diſcovery; there is an Application not only of Words to the Eye, or Ear, but of Conviction to the Mind. <hi>God who commanded the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of himſelf, with reſpect to the Time of his Converſion; <hi>When it pleaſed God to reveal his Son in me,</hi> Gal. 1.15, 16. This inward Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of a perfectly different kind from the bare revealing of Chriſt to us in the Letter of the Goſpel, though it be the ſame Chriſt, who is reveal'd both to us, and in us; for in the Work of Faith God inſpires the Soul with new
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41523:12"/>Perceptions of Divine Objects, ſo that there is communicated and imprinted another Senſe and ſight of thoſe very Things, of which we had formerly heard. The Spirit ſecretly ſuggeſts that which we never knew, concerning that which we did ſleightly and ſuperficially know. All the great Tranſactions of God which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Salvation, are within us, unſeen and unknown to any but our ſelves. 'Tis the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man which is transform'd and renewed in Knowledge; and the Spirit who does all this for us, is ſaid to be dwelling in us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Spirit Works freely in making this diſcovery. Though we are tyed to uſe the Means, he is not oblig'd to work by them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, upon every one that does enjoy them. He divides his Gifts and Graces to this and that Perſon, <hi>ſeverally as he will,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. He is compar'd to the <hi>Wind which bloweth where it liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> John 3.8. 'Tis not in vain, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Wind have the ſame Name in the Original Languages of the Scriptures, and in that extraordinary pouring out of the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2. <hi>There came a ſound from Heaven, as of a ruſhing mighty Wind, which fill'd the Houſe;</hi> becauſe as the Wind is not at the command of any Creature, with reference to its moving or ceaſing, blowing one way or another, ſo the Spirit of God is a free Agent in all his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he is under no neceſſity of enlightning thoſe whom he does enlighten; he does it for one, and not for another, in the hearing of the ſame Word, to ſhew that he Acts with the higheſt Liberty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11. <hi>It is given to you to know the Myſteries,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but to them it is not given.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41523:13"/>
               <p n="4">4. The Spirit Works effectually in theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries. He makes dead Letters to become lively Oracles. There is an Excellency of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which goes along with the Word, when he cauſes it to be receiv'd. <hi>According to his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which worketh in me mightily,</hi> Col. 1.29. The thick ſcales of Ignorance and Infidelity (like thoſe of the Leviathan, <hi>Job</hi> 41.17.) ſtick ſo cloſe, that it muſt be a ſtrong Hand which removes and ſeparates them from our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. There never was any ſaving Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Goſpel-Truths, to any Sinner in the World from the very beginning of it, without a Revelation of the Arm of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1. But whereſoever this Arm of God is revealed, the Report of the Goſpel is both underſtood and believ'd. This Omnipotent cauſe never fails of producing its intended Effect. So Chriſt expreſly ſays, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>Every Man that hath heard, and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> Every Man without one Exception.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Spirit Works in this Caſe, ſuitably to the Nature of our Faculties; he does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy or force them, but enlarge and improve them. He does not put out the Eye of our Minds, but open it. Our fooliſh Hearts are naturally darkned, and he does not impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but clear them. Every Believer can teſtifie this to the Honour of Chriſt, that his ſight hath not been taken away, but reſtor'd; as he boldly ſaid to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> John 9.25. <hi>One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I ſee.</hi> We were blind before, and thought that we ſaw; now we really ſee, and know that we were blind. The Underſtanding of a Man is the workmanſhip of God, and he does
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41523:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>not overthrow that, when he makes us new Creatures. The Demonſtration of the Spirit is ſuch as we cannot reſiſt, and yet it offers no Violence to us The Judgment is truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't, and we can ſay, <hi>We know whom we have believed,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Spirit in diſcovering of ſuch Truths, Works alone, and by himſelf. There is no Conjunction or proper Co-operation of ſecond Cauſes with him. It is here, as it was with thoſe, in <hi>Mat</hi> 20.34. <hi>Jeſus touched their Eyes, and immediately they receiv'd ſight.</hi> 'Tis the touch of Chriſts Hand only which recovers us from ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual blindneſs. Nature contributes nothing to the efficacious workings of Grace; and therefore 'tis obſerv'd, that many of the Holy Women whom our Lord deſcended from, were barren, to ſhew, that they Conceiv'd not by the ſtrength of their own Womb, but by vertue of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: As <hi>Sarah, Rebeckah, Rachel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So we are Light in the Lord,</hi> Eph. 5.8. But we do not help towards the creating of it in our ſelves. We are meerly Paſſive in the firſt Reception of Divine Light, as the Eye of the Body is truly Paſſive in the taking in of natural Light. All Light is brought into the Eye; ſo it ſprings in from Heaven into the Mind, which is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a very Dungeon of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What kind of Knowledge is that which is the Effect and Fruit of this diſcovery of ſaving Truth by God to the Soul. This is the rather to be inſiſted on a little, becauſe it may be of great Advantage to us in the Trial of our State, that we may make a right Judgment of our ſelves, whether under the Conduct of Fleſh and Blood, or of the Father.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41523:14"/>
               <p n="1">1. That Knowledge which proceeds from the ſpecial inward Revelation of Divine Things, is a more aſſuring Knowledge than any other. The end of <hi>Luke</hi>'s Writing his Goſpel to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> was, <hi>That he might know the certainty of thoſe things, wherein he had been inſtructed;</hi> Luke 1.4. This Effect the Spirit of God hath by his enlightning Operation beyond all humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions whatſoever; we are made to know the certainty of things, and more fully perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the great reality of what is ſpiritual. They are no longer doubtful, diſputable Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with us, but we come to ſuch a firm Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion about them, that we can venture our Eternity upon them. The Scripture hints this in many Places, <hi>John</hi> 17.8. <hi>They have known ſurely that I came out from thee.</hi> So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks <hi>of the Rich and full Aſſurance of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, in the acknowledgment of the Myſtery of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. And again, <hi>Our Goſpel came not unto you in Word only, but alſo in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much Aſſurance;</hi> ſo that there is no haeſitation or wavering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Knowledge which proceeds from ſuch a Cauſe, is more affecting than any other. The Heart is influenced to greater Love and Joy, and Admiration by what it believes and knows. As the mind receives more ſolid Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with reſpect to thoſe Truths, ſo thoſe Truths are more ſweet and delightful, more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing and tranſporting to the Soul. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks like a Man in an Extaſie, with more than ordinary Zeal and Fervour; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Yea, doubtleſs, I count all things but loſs for the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord.</hi> His
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41523:14"/>magnifying of the Excellency of this Knowledge, ſprung from his deep Senſe of the Excellency of the Object: He ſaw ſo much worth in Chriſt, that he would part with ten Thouſand Worlds, if he had them, for his ſake. The Doctrine of Chriſt's God-head, Incarnation, Satisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they are only taken into the Head as common Notions, are but dry Meat, but when they are impreſt by the Holy Ghoſt, we can feed upon them with Pleaſure. The Things of God being ſo reveal'd, that we taſte the ſavour of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Knowledge which is communicated by the Spirit, is always joyn'd with Experience. The Apprehenſions which other Men have by common reaſoning of ſpiritual Things, are like thoſe of a blind Man, when he hears a Diſcourſe concerning Light, which are very dark and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in Compariſon of his that hath Eyes to ſee the Sun. There is a vaſt difference between a Knowledge of Chriſt by Report and Hearſay (as one calls it) and a Knowledge of Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is gotten and improv'd by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. As the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was not told one half in her own Land of the greatneſs of <hi>Solomons</hi> Wiſdom, which ſhe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaw, and yet what ſhe was told, ſeem'd incredible to her, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.6. So Believers find ſo much in Chriſt, when they come to him, as does not only juſtifie the Report which Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters gave to be very true, but abundantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed it. We cannot tell you, what they feel whom Chriſt is formed in, and who live every Day by the Faith of him. Where there is no ſpiritual Senſe, the Mind is yet carnal.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Knowledge which the Spirit produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41523:15"/>does always iſſue in Obedience. The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which Men attain unto by any other Ways, is barren and unprofitable; as it does not reach the Heart, ſo it is of no uſe in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Converſation. But ſaving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge governs the Life, and regulates the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; ſo as clearly to exemplifie that Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God hath made between the Truths to be believed, and to be performed. When <hi>Paul</hi> prays for his <hi>Coloſſians, That they might be filled with the Knowledge of God's Will, in all Wiſdom and ſpiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> he does not ſtop there, but ſhews whither this tends, <hi>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9, 10. He that is truly nouriſht up in the words of Faith and good Doctrine will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it by fruitfulneſs in good Works, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.3. <hi>Hereby we do know that we know him (Jeſus Chriſt) if we keep his Commandments.</hi> They have not learned Chriſt as they ought, that do not live to him; for if we be acquainted with his Perſon, we ſhall ſubmit to his Rule.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p n="4">IV. WHerein lies the Bleſſedneſs which is annexed to this kind of Knowledge? Some bleſs themſelves, without Reaſon, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt Scripture bleſs themſelves, when they hear the Words of God's Curſe, <hi>though yet without Chriſt,</hi> who can only redeem them from that Curſe; thouſands of preſuming Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners call themſelves happy, when they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the very depths of Miſery, having but a ſhort ſtep, the thin Partition of an earthly Houſe, betwixt them and Hell; they think their Condition to be ſafe and good, and applaud and pleaſe themſelves in it as ſuch, when it is as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and as bad, as it can be, on this ſide of Everlaſting Deſtruction. But however miſtaken and deceived ſuch Men are, we know that Chriſt is true, and what ſays he here? <hi>Bleſſed art thou
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41523:16"/>Simon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for my Father hath revealed this unto thee, which Fleſh and Blood hath not,</hi> q. d. Thou art infallibly bleſſed upon this account, this is an undoubted Evidence and means of thy being ſo. Where then is the bleſſedneſs which the Text ſpeaks of? What does it conſiſt in, and how does it appear?</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis a bleſſed diſcovery which God makes, and a bleſſed Knowledge, which it produces, becauſe it is always accompanied with pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace. If there be a bleſſed Man in the World, without Controverſie it is the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sinner. Afflictions may remain, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring our bleſſedneſs, ſo long as Sin does not remain, which is the only Thing, that can ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Love of Chriſt, and how can this ſeparate, when God hath put it away, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved it from us? Who will not ſay, <hi>Amen</hi> therefore to what <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32.1. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the Man whoſe Tranſgreſſion is forgiven,</hi> &amp;c. Sin laies the Foundation of the Creatures Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, conſequently in the forgiveneſs of Sin, the Foundation of our Miſery is deſtroyed. Now this is always done, where Jeſus Chriſt is ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made known. This is plain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>This is the Covenant which I will make with them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will put my Laws into their Hearts, and in their Minds will I write them;</hi> and (immediately it follows) <hi>Their Sins and Iniquities will I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber no more.</hi> When there is this promiſed wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>within us,</hi> we may be ſure, there is a blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the hand-writing <hi>againſt us.</hi> Where Sin is uncover'd, the Heart is hid from Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but where the ſealed Book of Goſpel-Myſtery is open d, 'tis paſt all queſtion that the Debt-book is croſs'd.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41523:16"/>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis always attended with a perfect juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs. This is abſolutely neceſſary, in order to bleſſedneſs; for there muſt be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our loſt Title, before there can be a reſtoring to our forfeited Inheritance. 'Tis not poſſible that any one ſhould reign in Life, that does not receive of this Gift by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17, 18, 21. On the other hand bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is certainly entailed hereupon; <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Even as David deſcribes the bleſſedneſs of the Man to whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs without Works.</hi> Nothing can be more manifeſt, than that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of a Sinner is by the Imputation of the Obedience of Chriſt, without any reſpect to Works performed by the Sinner himſelf, and that the Sinner ſo juſtified, is truly bleſſed. Now 'tis as manifeſt, that every one who is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely and Spiritually illuminated, is thus bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. God never gave the Armour of Light to one Soul, but what he alſo cloathed with this Robe of Righteouſneſs. As the ſame Soul is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways both blind and naked, ſo the Eye-ſalve and the white Raiment, which Chriſt Counſels to buy of him, go together, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17, 18. Indeed we are juſtified by the Knowledge of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. For Faith which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his Righteouſneſs includes ſuch a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It hath always the Priviledge of Adoption going along with it. All bleſſedneſs is enclos'd within the Family of God; ſtrangers have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, but Children only. Every Man and Woman in the World, is a moſt wretched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done Creature, as He and She is a Son and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Adam;</hi> there can be no relief for us, but by the Contracting of a new Relation; they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41523:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>which be of Faith, <hi>are bleſſed with faithful Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam;</hi> Gal. 3.9. How bleſſed? <hi>Ye are all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ver. 26. Here comes in the recovery of our Bleſſedneſs, by being made the Children of God, adopted into the Houſhold of Faith. Now, to whom does <hi>Chriſt give Power to become the Sons of God, but to as many as receive him?</hi> John 1.12. and who are they that receive Chriſt, but they that are brought by God to know him? For the World that receiv'd him not, knew him not, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. The Devil blinds <hi>the minds of them that believe not,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. Natural blindneſs is the Cauſe of your Unbelief, as Judicial blindeſs is the Conſequent. Whereever there is the ſound Knowledge of Chriſt, there will be holy Truſt in him, and where this is, there is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sonſhip. Every Child of Light is a Child of God; if he hath viſited you with the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, you may boldly call him Father.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Divine Purity is chain'd to this bleſſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. The filth of Sin makes the Soul miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as well as the guilt of it. The Remnants of Corruption made <hi>Paul</hi> cry out of his being a <hi>wretched Man,</hi> Rom. 7.24. They make us wretched in Part, as long as we are here, though called to be Saints; but the Sinner who continues all over polluted, is only wretched. Darkneſs and defilement are inſeparable; while Men are groping in their natural State, they wallow in the Mire. But Purity of Heart gives a claim to bleſſedneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God ſhines into the Mind, he puriſies the Heart. The Sun of Righteouſneſs hath clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as well as healing in his Wings. 'Tis an amazing Conſideration, what dirt is carried out
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41523:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Soul, when Light ſprings into it. Our Lord's Prayer ſpeaks home to this Purpoſe, <hi>John</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy Truth,</hi> &amp;c. Error, as well as Ignorance is a Miniſter of Sin; but every Truth in Jeſus tends to ſanctifie, and is actually ſerviceable in the Sanctification of thoſe to whom it is revealed. <hi>Beholding the Glory of the Lord, changes us into his ſpotleſs I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. The Information which is given concerning Chriſt, hath a transforming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon thoſe that are Chriſts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Spiritual Liberty follows this bleſſed diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. How much of the Happineſs of humane Life is generally eſteem'd to conſiſt in outward Liberty! How irkſome is Confinement and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to all! How is a poor Vaſſal and Slave lookt upon, with a diſdainful Eye by the moſt, with a compaſſionate Eye by the beſt! How do Men hug themſelves in the little Immunities and Freedoms of this World? But what a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Thing is it (how much more bleſſed) to be reſcued from the ſervitude of the Devil, and deliver'd from the bondage of Corruption! The darkneſs of a ſinful State hath its Chains, as well as the darkneſs of Hell, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. When <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Eyes were put out, he was bound with Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Braſs, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.21. So it is with every unenlightened Sinner; he is under the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry command of Luſt, and taken Captive by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan at his Will; the Powers of darkneſs are his Keepers, and he hath no way of eſcape out of their Hands. But Light and Liberty come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by Chriſt, deliverance to the Captives, and recovering of ſight to the Blind, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. When he opens our Eyes, he opens our Priſons; <hi>John</hi> 8.32. <hi>You ſhall know the Truth, and the Truth ſhall make you free.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:41523:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="6">6. This kind of Knowledge, flowing from the ſpecial diſcoveries which God makes to the Soul, is no leſs than Eternal Life; which is the ſum, the complement, the top-ſtone of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bleſſedneſs. We cannot be more bleſſed than this makes us. To lay hold upon Eternal Life, is our utmoſt aim, and our higheſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. <hi>Now, this is Life Eternal to know God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent,</hi> John 17.3. It was ſaid of old, by thoſe that had viſible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appearances, <hi>We ſhall ſurely dye, becauſe we have ſeen God,</hi> Judg. 13.22. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where theſe inward Manifeſtations are, we may cry out, we ſhall ſurely Live, becauſe we have ſeen God in the Face of Chriſt. He that eats of this Tree of Knowledge, lives for ever, the preſent Fruit of this Tree, is the firſt Fruits of Heaven; 'tis Eternal Life in the Seed, and in the Bloſſom; 'tis the City of the living God, the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> coming down from God into the Soul. When the Underſtanding is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to take in the Things of Chriſt, 'tis a true opening of the Heavens to us. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation, in the Knowledge of him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That you may know what is the hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Why is bleſſedneſs annext to ſuch Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as this? Why is it limited to the Father's revealing of thoſe Things, which Fleſh and Blood cannot, and more particularly this Truth of the Godhead; which is not diſcoverable by Reaſon, but by him alone.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41523:18"/>
               <p n="1">1. Bleſſedneſs is not attainable by the meer Principles of natural Religion, however, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, and firmly believed. They that go no further than Nature will carry them, muſt needs come ſhort of the Glory of God. The Knowledge of natural Truths, is as inſufficient as the performance of Moral Duties; and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Inſtruction is as indiſpenſibly needful, as Evangelical Obedience. The World is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to know God to any Purpoſe by their own Wiſdom, as to ſerve him with Acceptance by their own Strength, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. The Light of Nature may leave Men without excuſe, but yet it leaves them alſo, without the effectual Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; it diſcovers ſo much as will aggravate Men's Ruine, but not ſo much as will procure their Relief. There muſt be the Faith of Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Reaſon, for no other Faith will ſave. Reaſon, as now maim'd and corrupted, is a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Star, which inſtead of leading unto Chriſt, will plunge the Souls, that are under his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, into outer Darkneſs. If a Man had all the Knowledge which 'tis poſſible for Fleſh and Blood to arrive to, he would be as far from the Kingdom of God, as the moſt illiterate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World. 'Tis Light from Heaven which prevents our falling into the Fire of Hell. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, 'tis hid to them that are loſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.3. The Underſtanding of all other My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries will avail us nothing, if we be ignorant of this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt is an Article of peculiar importance to the Everlaſting wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Souls. 'Tis a fundamental Truth, and they that would ſubvert our Faith in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, ſeem to ſay as thoſe <hi>Edomites</hi> did, in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>'s
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41523:19"/>deſolating Day, <hi>Raſe it, raſe it to the Foundvtion thereof,</hi> Pſalm 137.7. 'Tis the Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-ſtone in our Religion, upon which the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtands. It was the very firſt Doctrine that we hear of from the Mouth of <hi>Paul</hi> after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.20. <hi>Straightway he Preached Chriſt in the Synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</hi> The whole New Teſtament Church is oblig'd to have a ſpecial regard to this Confeſſion of <hi>Peter,</hi> in the Words before the Text; for in the Words immediately following the Text, our Lord ſays, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Rock will I Build my Church,</hi> ver. 18. It is therefore a moſt important Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; but this will further appear, if we conſider theſe Four Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We can have no hope of Salvation, but by Chriſt, as the Son of the Living God. If he were but a Man, we might juſtly put the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, How ſhall this Man ſave us? <hi>How can Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael be ſaved with an Everlaſting Salvation, but in the Lord?</hi> in Jehovah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.17. How is it true, that he would ſave them by the Lord their God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.7. If there be not Salvation in any other, but Chriſt, he therefore muſt be the Lord our God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We can have no acceſs to God, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, but by a Mediator, who is God. How ſhould one Creature introduce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Preſence of ſuch a terrible Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, who is at an infinite diſtance from all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? The Fellowſhip which we have with the Father, is through the Son; and therefore the Holy Ghoſt is pleas'd to link the greateſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with God, to a ſincere Confeſſion of the Deity of Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We can look for no Victory over the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41523:19"/>if we do not look to Chriſt as God. How is the Accuſer of the Brethren caſt down, but by the coming <hi>of the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Chriſt?</hi> Rev. 12.10. He muſt be the Chriſt of God, who hath Power enough to ſubdue and conquer ſuch an Adverſary. 'Tis the Lord that muſt rebuke him, a created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel cannot, <hi>Jude</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The World it ſelf will be too hard for us, if we are not helpt to encounter it by Chriſt as God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.5. <hi>Who is he that overcometh the World, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God?</hi> 'Tis in the Strength of this Faith that we muſt make ſucceſsful Oppoſition; we are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors by Vertue of his Conqueſt, <hi>John</hi> 16.33. And this Conqueſt ſuppoſes his Godhead; for a meer Man is as uncapable of overcoming the World, as of invading Heaven.</p>
               <p>There is an Objection lying againſt all this, in the very Chapter, where the Text is; <hi>ver.</hi> 20. If the Knowledge and Belief of what <hi>Peter</hi> had now confeſs'd be ſo eſſential to Bleſſedneſs, why ſhould Chriſt charge his Diſciples, at the very cloſe of this Diſcourſe, <hi>That they ſhould tell no Man that Jeſus was the Chriſt?</hi> Was he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that the neceſſary means of Salvation ſhould be afforded to that Age? Was he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to Conceal that from them, the Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof muſt needs be Mortal?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That unbelieving Generation were willingly, yea, willfully Ignorant, and therefore juſtly given up to be ſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Therefore ſpake Jeſus to them in Parables, becauſe they ſeeing, ſee not, and hearing, they hear not,</hi> &amp;c. They ſhut their Eyes, ſtopt their Ears, put away the Word from them, and therefore why ſhould it be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd or propos'd to them?</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:41523:20"/>
               <p n="2">2. The perſonal Doctrine and Miracles of Chriſt were ſufficient to have convinc'd them of this Truth, if they had given heed to them; therefore why ſhould the Apoſtles Preach the ſame thing? <hi>He ſpake as never Man ſpake;</hi> John 7.46. He did the Works, which no Man ever did, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.14. So that in Effect he told them himſelf, but they would not believe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There might be a prudential Reaſon in it; Chriſt would not by ſuch a Publication haſten his own Death. Some think on the contrary, he forbad their telling of this, that it might not hinder his Death; <hi>Becauſe if they had known, they would not have Crucified,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. But this ſeems much the more probable Reaſon; he would not draw upon him the Odium and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the <hi>Jews</hi> before the Time; ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 9.21, 22. <hi>He ſtraitly commanded them to t ll no Man that thing; ſaying, the Son of Man muſt ſuffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Things,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> This will provoke their Rage againſt me, which I muſt and will undergo, when my hour comes, but till then I deſign to avoid it. The <hi>Jews</hi> had a bloody Intention in urging him to tell them plainly, <hi>If he was the Chriſt,</hi> John 10.24. <hi>That they might accuſe him of Treaſon and Blaſphemy;</hi> and therefore he would anſwer them as they deſir'd; but when his Time was come, he owned this in expreſs Terms to the High-Prieſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.63, 64. <hi>I adjure thee by the Living God, that thou tells us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto him, Thou haſt ſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The great Proof of his Godhead was yet to come; <hi>viz.</hi> his Reſurrection; ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were to defer their Declaration of this Truth, till they could back it with this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He was declared to be the Son of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41523:20"/>God with Power, according to the Spirit of Holineſs, by the Reſurrection from the Dead.</hi> By the Spirit of Holineſs here, is to be underſtood, his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, which is put in Oppoſition to the Fleſh, his humane Nature, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. And the like Oppoſition we meet with, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. Now this Deity of Chriſt was moſt powerfully demonſtrated by his riſing from the Dead; for he rais'd and reviv'd himſelf, which a Creature could not do; he had Power to take his Life again, after he had laid it down, which no Creature ever had, <hi>John</hi> 10.18. And it was not poſſible that he ſhould be held by the Bands of Death, of which there is poſſibility enough as to any Creature, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> This Doctrine will hint many things which are proper both for our Learning, and Practiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are ſeveral Things which we have to Learn from hence. As 1. The Contemners of Divine Revelation, are miſerable forſakers of their own Mercies. <hi>He that refuſeth Inſtruction, deſpiſeth his own Soul,</hi> Prov. 15.32. This is moſt true, of ſuch as turn their backs with ſcorn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Goſpel of Chriſt; and ſuch a ſort of Men, there are at this Day in the World, that bid inſolent defiance to all reveal'd Religion. The Diſciples at <hi>Antioch</hi> choſe to be called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in Honour of their Lord, on whom they believed, but <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London</hi> hath bred a race of Monſters, that affect the differencing Name of Deiſts. What will the end of ſuch be? What can it be but Deſtruction, when Faith founded on the Scripture, is the only ſaving Wiſdom? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>From a Child thou haſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41523:21"/>known the Holy Scripture, which are able to,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ought to cauſe no Prejudice againſt real Chriſtianity, that the celebrated Men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Reaſon embrace it not. The Caſe is clear; our heavenly Father reveals theſe Things to all that know them, and he thinks ſit to hide them from ſuch, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>I thank thee, Oh Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt hid theſe Things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and haſt revealed them unto Babes; Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>'Tis no wonder therefore that not many wiſe Men after the Fleſh are called,</hi> 1 Cor 1.26. No wonder that there are ſo few, who will in any wiſe believe, what the Goſpel declares; the Doctrine of Regeneration was myſterious nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe (as one ſays) to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> an eminent <hi>Phariſee,</hi> a Ruler of the <hi>Jews,</hi> a Maſter in <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> ſo are other Things of the like kind to other Men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is no recommending Character of any Doctrine, that it is pleaſing and ſuitable to Fleſh and Blood. We have Reaſon to be Jealous that it is no ſpiritual Truth, which the natural Man very readily receives. The Doctrines which are promoted and countenanc'd by Fleſh and Blood, have the ſuſpicious Mark upon them of accurſed Doctrines. 'Tis no Argument why I ſhould give Credit to this or that Opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis grateful to Nature, but rather an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt it. The ſwift progreſs of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is owing very much to its ſmooth Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Stream of Nature. Nature leads all Men to build upon ſelf; but Chriſt will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that Man nothing, who expects to profit by any thing beſides him. 'Tis ill judging after the Fleſh; <hi>John</hi> 8.15. They judge beſt and moſt wiſely, that judge contrary to it.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41523:21"/>
               <p n="4">4. Viſible and nominal Chriſtians may ſit in darkneſs and the ſhadow of Death, as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Pagans.</hi> 'Tis a Light within us (in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, not Enthuſiaſtick Senſe) which is the true Light of Life. Men may live as much upon the Borders of Hell, where the Light outwardly ſhines, as where it ſhines not. The generality of the People in <hi>Judea</hi> receiv'd no more good by the Miniſtry of Chriſt, than they in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt Parts of the World, that never had it, <hi>John</hi> 1.5. <hi>The Light ſhineth in darkneſs, and the darkneſs comprehended it not.</hi> The real Myſtery of the Goſpel may be as little underſtood by Multitudes of Perſons here, as it is in the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Places of <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſtians are oblig'd to know, as well as do, more than others As we muſt do all the good that other Men do, and more, ſo we muſt know all the conſiderable Truths, that they know, and more. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Heathens,</hi> Rom. 1.19. <hi>That which may be known of God, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi> But there is a great deal more than this to be known by thoſe that Name the Name of Chriſt; or elſe, wo unto them. Thou believeſt that there is one God, thou doſt well; but this is not enough. <hi>Doſt thou believe on the Son of God?</hi> This is requir'd, and this was firſt ask of that Excommunicate Perſon by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 9.35. Unleſs thou knoweſt and believeſt more than all the Men in the World can teach thee, or learn of themſelves, thou art condemned alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is both a fruitleſs and a needleſs Thing to intrude into what we have not ſeen; as Perſons that are vainly pufft up by their fleſhly Minds,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41523:22"/>
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. It becomes us to be fully ſatisfied in what God is pleas'd to reveal or hide, and to pry no further, than Scripture-light Points out our way. This ſhould ſtop the curioſity of our enquiring Minds, that we may not demand any account of Things, but what God ſees good to give us. There is bleſſedneſs tied to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, but we make our ſelves oftentimes more unhappy by our own. He that increaſeth Prophetical Knowledge particularly, increaſeth Sorrow, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>The Man of God wept; and Hazael ſaid, why,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are ſome Things which this does very fitly put us upon the Practice. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſpeaks to Sinners, and ſhews what they ſhould do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. See your Wretchedneſs. You cannot be bleſſed, till the Father gives you a Revelation of his Son by his Spirit. Without this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Soul cannot be good; all that periſh are deſtroyed for lack of it. The external Form of Knowledge which you have, will be inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant to you. The Devils knew that he was Chriſt, and proclaim'd him to be the Son of God; but Chriſt rebuk'd them and would not receive any Teſtimony from them; it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to him, and unſerviceable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.41. And an heartleſs Confeſſion out of the Mouth of an Hypocrite, is as bad as from the Mouth of a Devil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be earneſt with God for the Cure of your Blindneſs. None can do it, but he; he can and will, if you unfeignedly beg it of him. The Promiſe lies ready for you to Plead, and he is ready to perform it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5. <hi>If thou cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt after Knowledge, and lifteſt up thy Voice for

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then ſhalt thou underſtand the Fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledge of thy God.</hi> You may ask ſaving Wiſdom, ſo as not to be denied; if you ask it as Perſons ſenſible, that your Life is bound up in this Requeſt, and if you ask it for Chriſt's ſake; for it was his Errand and End in coming into the World, <hi>That they which ſee not, might ſee,</hi> John 9.39.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſpeaks to <hi>Believers,</hi> and ſhews what they have to do.</p>
               <p n="1">2. Lift up your Heads and Hearts this Day with thankfulneſs to Heaven. This good News to thoſe that have heard Chriſt, and been taught by him, loudly calls them to give Glory to God in the higheſt, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 118.27. <hi>God is the Lord, who hath ſhewed us Light</hi> (even leſus Chriſt who is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken of, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>The great Light of the World</hi>) <hi>bind the Sacrifice with Cords,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in Judah is God known,</hi> Pſalm 76.1. <hi>Judah</hi> ſignifies Praiſe; what Hearts ſhould they have to Praiſe God, that have Underſtandings given them to know him; If God hath conferred this Bleſſedneſs upon you, what a rebounding of Bleſſing ſhould there be to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Value no Knowledge in Compariſon of this. Remember the Words of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. This exceeds all other Knowledge in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpects, eſpecially becauſe it diſcriminates the Friends of God from Enemies. 'Tis a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Priviledge allow'd to none, but the beloved of the Lord. Though you have no Reaſon to boaſt your ſelves againſt others, whom God makes you to differ from, yet you have abundant Reaſon to prefer and magnifie your own Lot. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15, 16. <hi>This People's Heart is waxed groſs, and their Ears are dull, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41523:23"/>their Eyes cloſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But bleſſed are your Eyes for they ſee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Walk as Children of Light.</hi> Neceſſity is laid upon them, <hi>That are Light in the Lord,</hi> to do ſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. Give no occaſion by diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſteps, for others to ſtumble and fall. As is ſaid in another Caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Let not your good be evil ſpoken of.</hi> Expoſe not the Doctrine of Chriſt to reproach by any unholy Acts, as if it were not a Doctrine according to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let all your Obſervers be witneſſes, that a renewed Mind will produce a reformed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Elſe you will Cloud your own Light, and thicken the Darkneſs of other Men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Make Conſcience of Praying for thoſe whom you uſually hear. Petition the King on the behalf of his Embaſſadors; and the more they have of his Preſence, the more are you like to get by their Labours. The more they have of the guidance of the Spirit of Truth, the more uſeful will their Teachings be to you. The ableſt Miniſter of the New Teſtament is inſufficient to think any thing of himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6. Unwearied Studies will bring forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wind without a Divine Influence. Pray therefore, that they may have <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, of God's being <hi>with their Mouth, and Teaching them what they ſhould ſay,</hi> Exod. 4.12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Depend ſtill upon God for continued diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries. Follow on the know the Lord, and breath after further views of him. God hath not yet ſhewed you all that he intends. The Work of Illumination is yet going on; <hi>The ſame anointing, which hath taught you, teacheth you of all Things,</hi> 1 John 2.27. There are ſtill the deep Things of God, which the Spirit muſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41523:23"/>ſearch out for you. Holy <hi>David,</hi> long after his firſt enlightening, beſeeches God to <hi>Open his Eyes, that he might behold wondrous things out of his Law,</hi> Pſalm 119.18. There are always freſh Wonders to be ſeen, which a freſh Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God muſt help us to diſcern.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Look for the perfecting of theſe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in a State of Glory. Say to God, as the ſame <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36.9. <hi>In thy Light ſhall we ſee Light.</hi> 'Tis but a kind of dim Twilight comparatively, which we enjoy here in this World; while we are hid in this Priſon-houſe, we can ſee but little; but our Fathers Houſe above, is full of Light; <hi>Then ſhall the Righteous ſhine forth as the Sun,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.43. If the Day-ſtar be irs'n in your Hearts, live in the pleaſant and chearful Expectation of perfect Day. For we can aſcend but a little way into the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdom, as long as we are upon the Foot-ſtool; and we ſhall know vaſtly and unconceivably more in the firſt Moment after we come to Heaven, then we are capable of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining here throughout all our Days.</p>

               <p>THE Time of compoſing this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſeems to be, before <hi>David</hi>'s coming to the Kingdom, but after God had given him the right of Succeſſion, when he was maliciouſly perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> and as unjuſtly defamed by his flattering Courtiers. And this was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable occaſion of his ſolemn Appeal here to the Judgment of God, who knew not only the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of his Cauſe in this particular Point, but alſo of his general Courſe. There are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Expreſſions to this Purpoſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. But the Reaſon and Ground of this Confidence, is ſet forth in the Words of the Text; <hi>For thy Loving Kindneſs is before mine Eyes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here are Four Things which need a little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What we are to underſtand by the Loving Kindneſs of God?</hi> The Word ſignifies, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, Mercy, Grace of God, and may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſerently render'd by any of theſe Terms,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41523:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>which do all amount to the ſame Thing. But</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This Loving Kindneſs may be taken either for an eſſential Perfection in God, or ſome external Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of good from God;</hi> that which belongs to his Nature, or that which he exerciſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Creatures. One is to be lookt upon as the Principle, and the other as the Product; one as the Original Cauſe and Spring, the other as the Effect which Streams and Iſſues from it. In the former Senſe, it may be underſtood, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.1. and in the latter Senſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42.8. And in both Senſes here in this Place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Loving Kindneſs of God diſplays and exerts it ſelf, in many Acts of Providence, but moſt eſpecially in Chriſt, and the vouchſafement of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal Bleſſings by him.</hi> Several of <hi>God's dealings with us</hi> in Temporals, are Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Tokens of his Favour; and if he were not as he is ſaid to be, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Of great Kindneſs,</hi> he would deal much other wiſe even in thoſe Things; but <hi>the Kindneſs and Love of God</hi> (that which is moſt eminently and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſo) appears in the Redeemer, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4. All the reſt is as nothing to this, and therefore this is chiefly underſtood here.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Loving Kindneſs of God may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as reſpecting others, or our ſelves;</hi> as the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God</hi> in general are the Objects of it, or as he hath made us ſo more particularly. Now though 'tis true, that the Favour which God bears to his People, deſerves our notice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, yet we are moſT apt to be affected with that which he ſhews to us. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Chriſt's loving his Church,</hi> Eph. 5.25. But he Triumphs in Chriſt's loving him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. So that when <hi>David</hi> ſays here, <hi>Thy Loving
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41523:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>Kindneſs,</hi> he means, <hi>Thy Loving Kindneſs to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What it is for God's Loving Kindneſs to be before our Eyes?</hi> 'Tis a way of Expreſſion which this Holy Man after God's Heart uſes elſewhere; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16.8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me.</hi> And it implies theſe Four Things in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To have it before our Eyes, is duely to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks <hi>of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding the Loving Kindneſs of the Lord,</hi> Pſalm 107. <hi>ult.</hi> If we have no Knowledge of it, it can have no Influence upon us; and that which is <hi>hid from our Eyes,</hi> in the Scripture ſtile, we are ſaid not to know, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To believe it, and be perſuaded of it.</hi> Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity makes Men hide their Faces from Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3. They that give no Credit to him, and have no Dependance on him, do not Care ſo much as to look towards him. But where Faith is exerciſed, the Eye is fixed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Believing is very often expreſt in the New Teſtament by Seeing, <hi>John</hi> 8.56. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To Eſteem and Prize it.</hi> As the <hi>caſting of the Word behind us,</hi> Pſalm 50.17. is an evidence of Contempt, ſo the keeping of our Eyes upon any Object, intimates the value which we have for it. And indeed, who can take a view of the heighth, and depth, and length, and breadth, thoſe unmeaſurable Dimenſions, of the <hi>Love of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 3.18, 19. Without having his Heart rais'd to an Holy Admiration? ſo as to cry out with <hi>David, How excellent is thy Loving Kindneſs, Oh God!</hi> Pſalm 36.7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>To conſider it, and be ſeriouſly mindful of it.</hi> As the Fear of God being before our Faces, <hi>Exod,</hi> 20, 20. Is to ſtand in actual awe of him,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41523:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>and to have the dread of his Majeſty upon us; ſo to have the <hi>Love of God in our Eye,</hi> is to have it impreſt upon our Minds, to roul it in our Thoughts, and make it the Matter of our fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Meditation. As the Spouſe ſays to Chriſt, <hi>We will remember thy Love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Song</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>What is meant by God's Truth here?</hi> It is capable of a Threefold Senſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Truth of God may import his immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faithfulneſs.</hi> So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.49 91.4. And many other Places. God is a God of Truth, and all creatures compar'd with him, are a Lye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His Truth may ſignifie his Word; which is called the Truth,</hi> Pſalm 119.142. And his Truth, <hi>John</hi> 17.17. As being given by his Inſpiration, and containing in it the Counſel of his Will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>His Truth may denote the Sincerity of thoſe that belong to him.</hi> This, though inhaerent in us, and acted by us, and therefore ſtiled our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.7. And our Uprightneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. Yet is the Truth of God, as 'tis enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.6. And implanted by him alſo; for all Truth is an Emanation from him, and he is the fountain of it, as the Devil is the Father of Lyes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>What is it to walk in his Truth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To Place our firm Reliance on the faithfulneſs of God.</hi> This may be taken in as Part of the Senſe; the trather becauſe the Pſalmiſt makes that Profeſſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>I have truſted in the Lord;</hi> and becauſe Experience of God's Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does embolden our Hope in his Truth; for indeed we can take no Comfort in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, except we have ſome Proofs of his Love. <hi>His Kindneſs and Truth often go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> but his Kindneſs is put firſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41523:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40.10, 11. Now, as the Phraſe of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God's Name is uſed by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Micah</hi> 4.5. So his Truth being a Part of his Name, we may be ſaid to walk in that, when we confide in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To attend ſtrictly to the Word of God;</hi> both as to the Doctrinal and Practical Parts of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As to the Doctrinal Parts of the Word,</hi> which are the Truths, that the Spirit leads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>John</hi> 16.13. Not barely into the Form of it, which is all that Hypocrites have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.20. But into the rooted Poſſeſſion. Hence this Truth is ſaid <hi>to dwell in Believers, and be with them for ever,</hi> 2 John 2. So that they ſhall not be turn'd aſide, nor led away by contrary Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As to the Practical Parts of the Word, which are the Rule of Life, and call'd the way of Truth,</hi> Pſal. 119.30. And the Truth which is after Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. For all Sin is countenanced by falſhood. This is the Truth which muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. And which we are requir'd to do, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6. For 'tis as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to guide our Practice by Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as to ſteer our Judgments by Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To be upright in our Way, in Oppoſition to that walking in craftineſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.2. <hi>Which is the celebrated Policy of the Children of this World.</hi> This ſeems to be aim'd at by <hi>David</hi> here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the very next Words, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts againſt going in with Diſſemblers. The Curſe that God hath pronounc'd againſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, ſhould make us afraid of being tinctur'd with the Leaven of Hypocriſie and Guile. Our walk is not as it ſhould be, if the Law of Truth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41523:26"/>do not govern our whole Converſation, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe Loins are girt about with it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Perſeverance in this Courſe, muſt alſo be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to fill up the Senſe.</hi> How is it a walking in the Truth, if it be only taking a ſtep, or two, and not a continued Motion? What leſs can it include, than a diligent Care to approve all our Ways to God to the very End of our Lives? If we do not this, we imitate the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>who abode not in the Truth,</hi> though he ſtood in it once, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. For though the greateſt Saints are too often guilty of ſinful wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings and ſtartings in their walk with God, yet the leaſt of them is never left finally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, or to quit the Road of Duty, The Words thus open'd, afford us this Point to be inſiſted on.</p>
               <p>Obſ. <hi>A deep and conſtant Senſe of the Love of God, does moſt powerfully engage and quicken to ſteady and ſincere Obedience.</hi> The Two Parts of this <hi>verſe</hi> are to be view'd in their Connexion, and then we ſhall ſee how clearly this Reſults from the whole. <hi>[Thy Loving Kindneſs is before mine Eyes]</hi> there's the Antecedent; <hi>[And I have walked in thy Truth;]</hi> there's the Conſequent.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>All that pretend to an Intereſt in the Love of God, have not their Hearts engag'd to ſuitable Obedience, for by many this is falſly pretended.</hi> The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> whom Chriſt wrote unto, <hi>Tryed them which ſaid they were Apoſtles, and were not, and found them Lyars,</hi> Rev. 2.2. So Multitudes that ſay, they are the Friends and Favourites of God, really are not, but by their own Practices diſcover themſelves Lyars. If they do not walk in God's Truth, 'tis moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they have not his <hi>Loving Kindneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes.</hi> Wile carnal Wretches too often delude themſelves in this Caſe, and the Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is very ſtrong, though it be ſo groſs and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. If any Man ſay, that he hath found Grace in the ſight of God, who makes little or no Conſcience of Duty to God, we muſt ſay, as <hi>John</hi> does on a like occaſion, <hi>The Truth is not in him,</hi> 1 John 2.4. To ſay that I ſhall have Peace, though I have no regard to Holineſs, and that God will make me up among his brighteſt Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, tho I lye wallowing in the Mire ſtill, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently to give the Lye to the whole Bible, as if we kenew the Mind of Chriſt better than himſelf. Such Imaginations as theſe are Oils that break the Head, and ſweeten'd Draughts that caſt in to a dead ſleep. Sinners that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſuch ſmooth Things to themſelves, Propheſie pernicious Deceits. The Viſions of their own Hearts will end in outer Darkneſs. They boaſt that God is well pleas'd in them, though they take no delight in ſerving of him; and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this boaſting; but their Foundation is in the Sand; they are not true Men, but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41523:27"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>All have not a full and uninterrupted Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Love of God, who do never the leſs yield the moſt unfeigned Obedience.</hi> God does not always put gladneſs into thoſe Hearts, where he puts his fear; nor always make his Face to ſhine, where he hath reſtor'd his Image. <hi>Though every one that doth right is born of God,</hi> 1 John 2.29. Yet every ſuch Perſon does not certainly know that his Father's Heart is towards him. Some may live under his Frowns, that yet live under his Authority; they may be too great Strangers to rejoycing in God, and yet will not renounce their Subjection to God; though they want the <hi>Light of his Countenance,</hi> yet <hi>his Law is a Lamp to their Feet.</hi> This is the Caſe of thoſe upright Souls, <hi>That walk trembling after the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 11.10. They are ready ſometimes to ſuſpect that God will have nothing to do with them, and yet they are reſolv'd to cleave to him; they walk ſo as to pleaſe him, though they have not like <hi>Enoch,</hi> the Teſtimony of their pleaſingneſs to him. God ſeems to be angry, and covers himſelf with a Cloud, and they are tempted to put the Queſtion, whether <hi>God's tender Mercies be not quite ſhut up;</hi> but notwithſtanding all this, they remember to do the Part of Children, they will perform the Duties of ſuch a Relation, whether he own them or not. The Generation of the Righteous make up but a very few, in Compariſon of that numerous World which lye in Wickedneſs, but we ſhould make them a great deal fewer then they are, if we ſhut out thoſe, that are ſometimes at leaſt, deſtitute of Divine Comfort. The Practice of univerſal Obedience is very Rare, but a ſtrong and unſhaken Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41523:28"/>of Faith is much more Rare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Natural Man that looks upon God as an implacable hater of him, can never heartily obey him.</hi> The ſerving of enemies is threatned by God as a puniſhment, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.48. And 'tis that which Nature hath a great reluctancy againſt, and will not be brought to ſubmit to, but by force. Conſcience of Guilt, and fear of Wrath, do not promote our walking with God, but obſtruct it. <hi>Adam</hi> ran away from God as ſoon as he had ſinned, and would never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to perform any act of Allegiance to him any more, if God had not reveal'd himſelf in Chriſt, and entred into a Covenant of Peace through a Mediator. When a Sinner ſees that God is againſt him, and concludes (as 'tis ſaid in the caſe of the <hi>Leviathan, Job</hi> 41.9.) <hi>that the hope of him is in vain,</hi> he will have no reſpect to any Command of God. A Man in a deſparate Condition, that thinks there is no Remedy, will break all Rules and Meaſures; he will be tied to nothing, becauſe he is under ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Apprehenſions that nothing can help him. A Spirit of ſlaviſh fear, which all awakened Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are naturally poſſeſs'd with till God ſhew them his Salvation, tends rather to plunge Men headlong into Hell, than to make them chooſe the way to Heaven; it is far more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to harden them in their Rebellion, than to reduce them to their Obedience, if there were nothing but the terrour of the Lord to be known, Converſion-Work would be impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The warmer our ſenſe is of Gods love to us, the livelier is our obedience to him.</hi> There is ſome proportion between the vigour of our ſervice, and our hopeful proſpect of his favour. Upon
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41523:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>this account there is not only a difference as to degrees of Holineſs among Saints themſelves (becauſe though they have all <hi>obtain'd like preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faith,</hi> they have not all obtain'd <hi>equal mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. compar'd with <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3.) but there is alſo a difference in the ſame Saints at ſeveral ſeaſons, according as they have more or leſs of the comfortable apprehenſions of the <hi>love of God</hi> (which is indeed a variable thing, I mean not the <hi>love of God it ſelf,</hi> but our <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of it) they are more or leſs <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Spirit ſerving the Lord.</hi> Though Duty be not intermitted (nor ever ſhould be) for want of comfort, yet in the enjoyment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Duty is perform'd in a more active and chearful manner. Every Child of God hath his <hi>dark and gloomy,</hi> as well as his <hi>bright and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant days;</hi> and this change, as to his ſpiritual joy, will produce ſome alteration in the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Grace.</hi> The leſs ſenſible Manifeſtations of God there are to the ſoul, the more ſenſible deadneſs there is in holy Duties. Our Wings are clipt, and we cannot mount up, as at other times; but when we receive the ſight of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled God in Jeſus Chriſt, this wonderfully enlarges the heart, and we can not only <hi>walk in Gods Truths,</hi> but <hi>run in the way of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Though a ſence of the love of God do quicken to obedience; yet there is a neceſſity of obedience laid upon us by vertue of the Law; for the Law is not made void through this faith, but eſtabliſht,</hi> Rom. 3.31. The Law reveals what we ought to do, and a diſcerned Intereſt in the Love of God gives us the higheſt encouragement to the doing of it. We are not the leſs, but the more obliged by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41523:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>this means, to <hi>walk according to rule,</hi> and that Rule is the Declared <hi>Will of God.</hi> Though we are helpt to obey upon Goſpel Principles, yet we are bound to obey on the account of the Precept. No Man more ſway'd and influenc'd by Grace than <hi>Paul</hi> was, yet he profeſſes <hi>that he was not without Law to God, but under the Law to Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.21. We owe a Debt of <hi>ſervice to God,</hi> though Chriſt hath diſcharg'd the <hi>Debt of Sin.</hi> He hath fulfill'd <hi>the Law for us,</hi> in order to our Juſtification, and yet we are to fulfil it our ſelves, for the evidencing of our Sanctification. The Law is ſtill in force, for our direction in Duty; though Chriſt hath ſo far aboliſht it, as to free Believers from the penalty, it retains its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power, though it hath loſt its condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power, in which reſpect 'tis ſaid <hi>that the Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſohedient, for the ungodly, and for ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.3. The threatned Curſe takes hold of Men out of Chriſt, the Injunctions to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by thoſe in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>A ſence of the love of God is the chief motive to Obedience, though it be not the only one.</hi> There are other Conſiderations, which have their Place and Uſe, and ought to work upon us, but this more than any; they may and ſhould contribute to the ſame end, but this is moſt effectual. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Sence of God's abſolute as well as relative Goodneſs.</hi> I mean, to conſider how good a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter he is in himſelf, ſhould be an inducement to ſerve him; as 'tis poſſible that ſome may be willing to do ſervice to an extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from a reſpect to his inherent Worth. The <hi>Matchleſs Excellencies of God,</hi> whom none in Heaven or Earth can be likened to, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41523:29"/>us to take a pleaſure in his work; it ſhould be our <hi>meat and drink</hi> to do the Will of ſuch an one, for the ſake of what he is; for the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him who is ſo glorious, muſt needs be our own Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A ſence of God's Sovereignty and Dominion over us.</hi> Who can refuſe to yield himſelf to God, that is ſeriouſly convinc't of his infinite Right to command and govern him? He may challenge from us all that we can do; for both our Being and active Power is from him. He hath made us for himſelf; and we may as well diſown his being our Creator, as deny him to be our Ruler; but what kind of Ruler do we make him, if we are not his ſervants to obey? Subjection follows upon Dominion, or is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it: <hi>He is the Lord, and worſhip thou him, Pſal.</hi> 45.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The conſideration of the purity of the precepts which God calls us to obſerve.</hi> This made the <hi>Word of God</hi> ſo amiable to <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.140. It requires nothing of us but what highly becomes us, and behoves us; nothing but what 'tis our Honour and Intereſt to comply with. The <hi>work of God</hi> is of the nobleſt kind, ſuch as none but a filthy depraved Creature would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be exempted from. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſies the Holineſs, Juſtice, and Goodneſs of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. And upon that ſcore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his Conſent to it, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. And delight in it, <hi>ver.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Conſideration of the Reward which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in Obedience at preſent, and which is reſcrv'd for us hereafter.</hi> Theſe are proper encouraging Thoughts, and ſhould recommend our Duty to us. The Reward which attends our doing it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41523:30"/>is great; the Reward which is laid up, till we have done it, is greater; and this would not be ſo far revealed as it is, but that it might be a ſpur to us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23, 24. <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do it heartily,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>knowing that of the Lord you ſhall receive the Peward of the Inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. He that hath the Hope of ſuch a promis'd bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, ſhould be excited by it to univerſal Holineſs. And yet the main Argument of all is the Love of God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>To offer ſome Proofs for the Demonſtration of this Truth.</hi> As.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>No Man hath ſuch a Senſe of the Love of God, but the Elect Sinner upon his return to God;</hi> he is the only Subject of it. And therefore it muſt needs very powerfully engage to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>None but the Elect Sinner hath a true Senſe of the Love of God.</hi> This Treaſure is put only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to choſen Veſſels; this hidden Manna is only for God's hidden ones, and conſequently there is no danger of its corrupting, but it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nouriſh Grace, and ſtrengthen to Duty. As none <hi>but they that are written in the Lamb's Book enter into Heaven,</hi> Rev. 21. <hi>ult.</hi> So this Heaven upon Earth does not enter into any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. There are a peculiar number whom God hath ſet his Love upon, and this peculiar num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are the only Perſons whom he manifeſts it to; <hi>The aninting which teacheth us all things, is Truth and no Lye,</hi> 1 John 2.27. How then can they be taught the Knowledge of God's Love, whom his Soul hates? And on the other Hand how can they turn this againſt the Intereſt of Holineſs, who are choſen that they might be Holy?</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41523:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Elect Sinners have not ſuch a Senſe, but when they are upon their return to God.</hi> When Chriſt is about to be formed in the Soul, thoſe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Love of God</hi> do greatly promote and help it forward; if they have been Enemies in their Minds, they ſhall not continue ſuch; If they have done Iniquity, they ſhall do no more; they ſhall not go on in their Treſpaſſes, after the <hi>Grace of God</hi> is ſo diſplay'd in their Remiſſion. The white Stone is too great a Jewel to be caſt before thoſe filthy Swine, that will turn again and rend, or trample it under their Feet. The choſen of God themſelves have it not, till God is calling them home to himſelf. The Time of Converſion is the Time of Love, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. The Time not only of God's Exerciſing, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting Love to the Sinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>None can impreſs ſuch a Senſe of God's Love upon us, but the Spirit of God;</hi> he is the only Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, and therefore it muſt needs quicken to Obedience. Falſe hopes and groundleſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, which do tend indeed to the Patronizing and Encouraging of Sin, ariſe from our ſelves and from the Devil; but the Conſolations of God, which always produce <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> are from the Spirit, as he Works <hi>Love to God in us,</hi> ſo he witneſſes <hi>Gods Love to us.</hi> As we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the Sun but by its own Light. So we cannot ſee the Face of God with Joy, but by a beam from himſelf. We can no more know that God is at Peace with us, meerly by our own Underſtandings, than we can reconcile our ſelves to him by the Power of our own Wills; our Hearts are naturally like an Hell; as there is a burning Fire of inſatiable Luſt, ſo biting Worms of endleſs Fears. The ſtupid Sinner is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41523:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>hard to be Convinced, and the Convinced Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner refuſes to be Comforted. We are as far from the applying of Promiſes, as from heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to Precepts; and as we cannot be ſubject to the Law, ſo we can get no relief by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. But the bleſſed Spirit, he does both <hi>let us know the Things which are freely given us of God;</hi> 1 Cor. 2.12. And alſo the Things which are indiſpenſibly requir'd of us by God; we ſhould never know that God is our Father, without this Spirit of Adoption. <hi>The Love of God is ſhed abroad in our Hearts by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 5.5. And as he diffuſes it there, ſo he improves it to Holy Purpoſes; his ſanctifying Operations are always befriended and aſſiſted by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Teſtimonies.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>THE Promiſes which Declare and Confirm the Love of God to us, are ſpecial means of working Holineſs in us.</hi> As they aſſure our Deliverance from Wrath, ſo they promote our Salvation from Sin. Divine Promiſes do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to beget us to a lively Hope, but they help to produce and maintain the Life of every Grace; they are the ſpiritual Food of Souls, which does both nouriſh our Faith, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us to Obedience. We do not obtain any Goſpel Priviledge by the Performance of Duty, but Duty is effectually enforc't by the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Goſpel Priviledges. God brings us to take hold of hsi gracious Covenant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fortifie us againſt turning from the Holy Commandment. This is plainly ſet forth as the Way and Method in which he firſt Works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and enables us to Work, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore theſe Promiſes, let us cleanſe our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41523:32"/>ſelves from all filthineſs both of Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. The Promiſe of God's being a Father to us (which is mention'd in the laſt verſe of the foregoing Chapter) is a ſtronger Inducement to purifie our ſelves and be Followers of him, than any threatening of God's being a Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. So 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Exceeding great and precious Promiſes are given unto us, that by theſe you might be Partakers of the Dikvine Nature,</hi> &amp;c. As the chief Thing communicated from God is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, whereby we are made to reſemble him, ſo the Promiſes of God ſet home upon the Soul, are the means of Communication; they are to Milk and Honey of the Scripture, which do not cheriſh the Old Man, but ſupport the New; they are not Pillows for ſinful Sloth, but ſpurs to Holy Diligence. The Promiſes of Grace animate the Soul to Duty; and when we thus ſee the goodneſs of the Lord, it encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges our Subjection to his Government.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A Senſe of the Love of God will create in us a more perfect hatred of Sin;</hi> Divine Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Perſons, breeds the moſt implacable Enmity againſt our Luſts; when we know that God is pacified towards us, it makes us loath and abhor our ſelves the more, in remembrance of the Evils we have done. If he paſſes by Tranſgreſſion, the pardoned Tranſgreſſor ſixes his Eye upon it with greater Indignation; as <hi>David's Sin was ever before him,</hi> though <hi>Nathan</hi> had told him from God, that his Sin was put away, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.3. compar'd with 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. For the Title of that Pſalm informs us, that it was penn'd after <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet had come to <hi>David.</hi> A Sinner is never ſo odious in his own ſight, as when he is perſuaded of his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41523:32"/>being precious in the ſight of God. How does <hi>Paul</hi> repeat and aggravate the foul Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his natural Phariſaical State, when he knew himſelf to be belov'd of God, and eſtabli ſhed in Chriſt; he ſpeaks of his perſecuting and waſting the Church of God beyond meaſure, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.13. So with Holy Confuſikon he bewails what he once was, <hi>after he had obtained Mercy, and after the Grace of our Lord Jeſus had exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly abounded towards him,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13, 14. Though God had made him whiter than Snow in the Lamb's Blood, yet he ſtill ſets out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own black and filthy Colours. We do not loſe the Proſpect of our own vileneſs, by having the <hi>Kindneſs and Love of God before our Fyes,</hi> but we ſee it the better. His gracious Abſolution kindles the moſt flaming Zeal and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in us againſt the Sins from which we are abſolved; conſequently is a mighty furtherance of our Obedience.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>A Senſe of the Love of God is moſt apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get an awful fear of Falling under his diſpleaſure.</hi> That I may not be miſtaken, let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That this awful Fear is not only diſtinct from dreadful Horrour, but oppoſite unto it.</hi> The trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of a Devil, and the trembling of a Child are real Contraries. Godly jealouſie of our ſelves, and ſinful Diſtruſt of God, are two things of moſt different Kinds. The fear of Caution (which I would recommend) keeps us walking cloſely with God, the fear of Deſperation (which I would warn againſt) hurries us vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently away from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That this diſpleaſure of God, which Believers are lyable to fall under, is exercis'd only in this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41523:33"/>World, and not in the next.</hi> That Wrath which God occaſionally lets out againſt his own, is not the ſame with that which comes <hi>upon the Children of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 5.6. We muſt not confound the temporary hidings of God's Face, with Everlaſting Deſtruction from God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. He that believes, is ſecur'd from ſinal Condemnation, but nevertheleſs he is ſtill inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſad Deſertion. Now for the Soul to be kept under the awe of this, is a great help to our Obedience; and where the Love of God is perceived by the Soul, this awe will certainly prevail. God's ſanctified ones can ſay it from Experience, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 130.4. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayſt be feared.</hi> Not only a readineſs to forgive, but actual forgiveneſs is with God; and as our Fear of God is the end of his granting it, ſo 'tis the effect and iſſue of our receiving it.</p>
               <p>Two Things will make this more evident,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This joyful Senſe of the Love of God, ſuppoſes a ſorrowful Senſe of his diſpleaſure going before it.</hi> Ordinarily God does not thus ſet Men up on high, till he hath firſt brought them into the Depths; the does not make them <hi>glad with his Countenance,</hi> till he had <hi>laid them</hi> (more or leſs) <hi>in the loweſt Pit, Pſalm</hi> 88.6. How few are admitted to take the <hi>Cup of Salvation,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Drinking for ſome time of the Cup of <hi>God's Fury!</hi> How few are call'd into this pleaſant Light, without paſſing through a ſcorching Fire? Sore Conflicts prepare the way, for the moſt part, to raviſhing Comforts; and the Heart knows a great deal of bitterneſs, before it comes to taſte <hi>how good the Lord is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They that have been ſenſible of God's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41523:33"/>and are ſenſible of his Love, will take Care to avoid the one, and continue in the other.</hi> Who ſo likely to be afraid of receiving a Spirit of Bondage again, as they that have felt it? Who ſo far from provoking God to carry them back into an howling Wilderneſs, as they who have been there before? Who ſo cautious of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting their ſweet Communion with God, as they that have enjoy'd it? Who ſo capable of rightly valuing that Priviledge, as they that are poſſeſt of it, and therefore who ſo ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the preſerving of it by a circumſpect Walk? Souls that are thus favoured of God, are moſt ſeriouſly convinc't, <hi>That in his Favour is Life,</hi> Pſalm 30.5. Therefore when the Spirit of God hath carried them up to this Pinnacle, this heighth of Conſolation, they are the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of doing any Thing to occaſion their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting down.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The commoneſt and ſtrongeſt Temptations to departing from God are beſt overcome by a Senſe of his Love;</hi> viz. The Temptations which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe both from the flatteries and frowns of the World, the <hi>Love of Life,</hi> and <hi>Fears of Death.</hi> He that hath the <hi>Loving Kindneſs of God before his Eyes,</hi> is moſt able to make a reſolute and ſucceſsful Reſiſtance to all theſe. As particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Flatteries of the World do too often allure Men from their Obedience to God;</hi> but they that have a Senſe of God's Love upon their Hearts, are beſt armed againſt this Temptation. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the World, with all its gaudy Vanities, is Crucified to us, and we unto the World; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all theſe Things are ſtript of their ſeeming Glory, as the Sun puts out the leſſer Lights, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41523:34"/>as the Works of Nature ſpoil the Reputation of the Works of Art, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4.7. <hi>Thou haſt put gladneſs in my Heart, more than in the Time when their Corn and Wine increaſed.</hi> If we had more ſpiritual Delight in God, carnal Fruitions muſt needs be a leſs powerful bait. 'Tis in vain for the Devil to entice that Soul with a few drops of Pleaſure that run through broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, which partakes of ſatisfying Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the <hi>Fountain of Life;</hi> theſe Things are only ſuited to the Palates of thoſe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>know the Joy of the Lord.</hi> Heaven's Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites cannot fall in Love with Earths, <hi>'tis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for a Believer that's cloathed with the Sun, to have the Moon under his Feet,</hi> Rev. 12.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Frowns of the World too often ſcare Men from their Obedience, but a due Apprehenſion of the Love of God, is a good Security againſt this Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation alſo.</hi> The belief of God's reconciled Heart, and view of his pleaſed Countenance is enough to make us Triumph over the fierceſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of Men and Devils. It Matters not who they be that are againſt us, nor what they can do againſt us, ſo long as we know that God is for us. This will make us Glory in Infirmities, Neceſſities, Diſtreſſes and Afflictions of all ſorts: For he that can encourage himſelf, with <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 30.6. <hi>In the Lord his God,</hi> will not be diſmayed by any of theſe Things. Bitter Herbs will go down very well, when a Man hath ſuch <hi>delicious Meats which the World knows not of.</hi> The Senſe of our Father's Love is like Honey at the end of every Rod; it turns Stones into bread, and Water into Wine; and the Valley <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Trouble into a Door of Hope; it makes the biggeſt Evils ſeem as if they were none, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41523:34"/>than none; for it makes our Deſarts like the Garden of the Lord, and when we are upon the Croſs for Chriſt, as if we were in <hi>Paradice</hi> with Chriſt. Who would quit his Duty, for the ſake of Suffering, that hath ſuch relief under it? Who would not rather walk in Truth, when he hath ſuch a Cordial to ſupport him, than by the Conduct of fleſhly Wiſdom, to take any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct or irregular Methods for his own Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Love of Life is a very frequent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Snare, which a Senſe of God's Love muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from being entangled by.</hi> What ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as Life, if a Man have no Place in the Heart of God? This is the greateſt Temporal Bleſſing, and nothing can out do it, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the God of our Life. And this excels indeed; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy Loving Kindneſs is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Life.</hi> What Compariſon is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Breath in our Noſtrils, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of an Eternal God? Any more than there is between an Everlaſting Light, and a poor va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Vapour, compare <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.19. with <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.14. Who would not therefore hate his own Life, which hangs in doubt continually before him, and of which he can have no Aſſurance, when he knows that the Living God is his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Portion? Who would not freely yield up and part with Ten Thouſand ſuch Lives one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another (if he had ſo many) rather than the Wrath of God ſhould be kindled but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Fear of Death is a very uſual and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Snare too, which can hardly be broken without a Senſe of the Love of God.</hi> Death which will rend and tear the Soul from the Body, is the Lion in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41523:35"/>the way, which diſcourages and affrights many from hazardous Duties; thouſands through ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cowardize have rather choſen to ſhipwrack their Faith, and proſtitute their Conſcience then mingle their Blood with their Sacrifices. But now they that have the Comforts of God to delight their Souls, are more willingly brought to this King of Terrors; if God cauſe his Face to ſhine, what ſhould hinder our chearful deſcent into the Valley of the ſhadow of Death? Love is ſtrong as Death, and a great deal ſtronger; one would dare to Dye for a good Man, whoſe Love and Friendſhip hath endear'd him to us; how much more for a God whoſe kindneſs hath been ſo exceeding? This hath made ſo many Martyrs glorifie God in the midſt of the Fires; when they have been kill'd for Chriſt's ſake all the day long, <hi>and counted as Sheep for the ſlaughter, they have been more than Conquerours through him that lov'd them,</hi> and through the lively Impreſſion of that Love upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36, 37.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The New Nature is ingenuous, and therefore will be wrought up to Obedience by the Love of God.</hi> After we have taſted that the Lord is gracious, we readily ſavour all the Things of God. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maue Nature indeed in our lapſed, depraved State, may Reward Evil for Good, and Hatred for Love (as <hi>David</hi>'s Enemies did to him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 109.5.) before a ſaving Change is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd on the Soul; but it neither is nor can be ſo, when God gives Men another Heart, as he does at their New-birth. Then nothing eies us ſo faſt to our Duty, as thoſe bands of Love; nothing is ſo ſweetly, and yet ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attractive, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>With Loving Kindneſs have I drawn thee;</hi> they that are only haled and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41523:35"/>drag'd by legal Terror, will be ſtriving to break away again, and looſe themſelves from the Yoke of Chriſt, but Love ſubdues all Things to it ſelf; it conſtrains to ſuch Acts of Duty, as make the mad World think us <hi>beſide our ſelves;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13, 14. The Soul is compell'd to come in to Chriſt, and yet it walks at Liberty; 'tis ſo ſwayed by a Principle of Holy Gratitude, as that it is always ſtudying that Point, <hi>What ſhall I render?</hi> For this is a Principle that never fails to operate, where the Root of thankfulneſs is, the Fruit of Service cannot be wanting. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle beſeeches by the Mercies of God, that we preſent our Bodies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. Love hath a mighty prevalency in the obtaining of all that is deſir'd; <hi>Herod</hi> would do any Thing at the Requeſt of his beloved <hi>Herodias: Eſther</hi> choſe that Time to perfer her Petition, when ſhe was expreſſing her Love to the King in a Banquet; ſo when Chriſt is feaſting a Believer with his Fat Things, <hi>with his Love which is better than Wine,</hi> the raviſht Believer can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or grudge him nothing.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>That Love to God which a due Senſe of the Love of God does produce in us, is virtually all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi> This Conſideration conſiſts of two Branches, which (to give it the greater Evidence and Force) may be diſtincty open'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A due Senſe of the Love of God to us produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Love in us to God,</hi> 1 John 4.19. <hi>We Love him, becauſe he firſt loved us. Sic res accendunt lumina rebus.</hi> Sanctified Affections are blown up in us, by the believing Perſuaſions of <hi>Divine good Will towards us.</hi> As there is ſomething like an exchange of Souls between Boſom Friends, ſo there are returns and reboundings of Love
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41523:36"/>betwixt God and thoſe, whoſe Hearts are knit to him. The Spouſe of Chriſt proclaims their mutural Endearments in one Breath, and alſo in the right Order. <hi>Song</hi> 2.16. <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> God is the Ocean from which Love firſt flows out, and to which it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtreams back. Love, when it hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Heaven to Earth, hath finiſhed but half its Courſe, but when it aſcends from Earth to Heaven, the Circle is compleated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This Love which is the Product of God's, is virtually all Obedience;</hi> both as it inclines and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes unto all, and as it comprehends all in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It diſpoſes and inclines to all Obedience.</hi> When the Heart is melted by his Fire within, 'tis eaſily caſt into the mould of any Precept whatſoever. As it puts us upon keeping the Commandments of God, ſo it keeps them from being grievous, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. Obedience can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be partial nor burdenſome, where-ever this Love of God dwells; but it fulſils the Charge which <hi>David</hi> gave to <hi>Solomon, of ſerving God with a perfect Heart, and a willing Mind,</hi> 1 Chron. 28.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It comprehends all Obedience in it ſelf.</hi> The end of the Commandment, <hi>is Charity,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. Both Tables are reduc'd by Chriſt to two Commandments, and Love is the grand Inſcription of them both. <hi>Therefore Love is ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.10. All the Duty which we owe to God and to our Neighbour is included in Love to each. And indeed we cannot walk in God's Truth, unleſs we walk in Love to one another, as well as to him. Our Alienations from our Brethren ſpeak our diſtance from Chriſt the Center of our Union. The nearer any Lines in a Circle come to the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41523:36"/>Center, the nearer they are one to another; but the further they go from the Center, the more they run out one from another.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>To Apply this,</hi> What are we to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of, and exhorted to?</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, Information.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If our Obedience be excited by the Love of God, then the Love of God prevents our Obedinence.</hi> If we did firſt give to God, he is able infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to recompence it again, above what we can think; but who is it <hi>that hath firſt given unto him?</hi> Rom. 11.35. There is not one whoſe Heart God hath touched, that will dare to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. We do not commend our ſelves to God, but God manifeſts himſelf to us. The Love of God was not purchas'd even by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Chriſt, much leſs by ours, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. <hi>Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for our Sins.</hi> The ſending of the Son was the Effect of the Father's Love; and therefore the Son's coming could not be the Cauſe of it. How then can we procure what Chriſt did not? His Love is not beſtow'd upon us for our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but is the incentive to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis blaſphemy againſt the Love of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is with being the Parent or Nurſe of carnal Security.</hi> They that have the Kingdneſs of God in their Eye, can take no Encouragement from thence to ſet any wicked Thing before them; for Sin tends to Cloud that Light, wherein we rejoyce. If God be well pleaſed with us, it lays the greater Engagement upon us to walk worthy of him. How abſurd is it to ſay, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41523:37"/>when God communicates his Thoughts of Peace, the Soul is embolden'd to new Acts of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? As if Men ſhould lay aſide the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him?</hi> Pſalm 25.14. Or as if the Spirit of Adoption took Men off from <hi>Obedience to God,</hi> when they are call'd to be <hi>Followers of him as dear Children,</hi> Eph. 5.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They that by looſe and diſorderly Practices give any occaſion to ſuch Blaſphemers, have a great deal of Sin to anſwer for, beſides their own.</hi> If any of us Cauſe this way of Truth, to be evil ſpoken of, we bring the guilt of thoſe Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies upon our ſelves. It will be an heavy load to a tender Conſcience, if ſound Doctrine is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd through our unmortified Corruption. How do we wrong the Purity of the Goſpel, when we turn the Grace of our God into laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs! <hi>For the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation, teacheth us the contrary,</hi> Tis. 2.11, 12. What is this, but to change the Glory of God into an Image made like to unclean Spirits! Wo to thoſe <hi>Libertines,</hi> by whom this offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth! What Jealouſie and Rage does that Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs deſerve, who impudently abuſes her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Love?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Grace of God in us is a comforting Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Love to us.</hi> Though Holy Walking is no Foundation for Truſt, we may reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a Token for good. 'Tis ſaid of the way of Holineſs, that the redeemed ſhall walk there, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.8, 9. as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s Pardon is concluded from her Affection, ſo if God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us to make ſtraight Paths for our Feet, 'tis a ſign that he hath ſet his Heart upon us. As all Obedience iſſues from the Spirit, ſo the Gift
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41523:37"/>of that Spirit is a Teſtimony of peculiar Favour, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.29. <hi>Neither will I hide my Face any more from them, for I have poured out my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>A denial of the poſſibility of Aſſurance is injurious to Holineſs.</hi> The firſt and beſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were ſuch as could ſay, <hi>we have known and believed the Love which God hath to us,</hi> 1 John 4.16. <hi>And they that have had the ſame Spirit of Faith, have always approved themſelves the greateſt Saints in all ſucceeding Times;</hi> but to ſay, that this their belief was a Deluſion, is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to ſay that all their Religion was a Cheat too, which in this more degenerate Age is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be matcht. To ſtake Men down to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ſuſpended waverings about their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Love of God, is to deſtroy the moſt quickening Motive to Obedience.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Chriſtian Life is as far from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, as from being irregular.</hi> What great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Pleaſure can there be, than to be conſtantly influenc'd by the <hi>Love of God</hi> to the <hi>Service of God?</hi> A dull and ſowre Complexion does not belong to real Chriſtianity, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and Gladneſs for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in Heart.</hi> Though <hi>Cain</hi>'s Countenance fall, <hi>Abel</hi>'s Race may lift up their Heads. If there be any Conſolation in Chriſt, they that are his, have reaſon to rejoyce; and what more ſure, than that there is all in him, and none out of him? <hi>He hath a Chariet of Gold paved with Love, for the Daughters of Jeruſalem,</hi> Song 3.10. What ſo delightful, as to go up and fit with him in that Chariot?</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:41523:38"/>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Think not only on the Love of God in general, but on the moſt affecting Properties of it in Particular.</hi> Such as</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Its Antiquity. God loved us from Eternity,</hi> before we were, and before the World was; and there have been Early diſcoveries of it; there is the <hi>Love of God to us</hi> in our Childhood, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1. <hi>And his Kindneſs in our Youth,</hi> Jer. 2.2. Which are both Seaſons of Vanity. <hi>The Loving Kindneſſes of God</hi> are not of Yeſterday, but of very ancient Date; <hi>They have been ever of Old,</hi> Pſalm 25.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Its Freeneſs, according to the Tenor of his Promiſe,</hi> Hoſ. 14.4. His Love is the Reaſon of it ſelf; <hi>He loves, becauſe he loves,</hi> Deut. 7.7, 8. And it muſt needs be ſo, if we conſider what unamiable Creatures we are. God bids us to love our Enemies, and he himſelf is the great Example of it. He loves our Perſons, when he hates our Enmity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Its enlargedneſs. He ſhews Loving Kindneſs to Thouſands,</hi> Jer. 32.18. And he Crowns eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of thoſe Thouſands with it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.4. He hath many Objects to let it out unto, and every one of theſe Objects ſtands in need of multiplied Acts; yet the Fountain of Mercy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflows to all, and remains ſtill full.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Its Stability.</hi> 'Tis unmovable and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8. No Creature can ſeparate us from it. The Anger of God is tranſient, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.1. But his Love is permanent. The Time will come, when God will be Angry no more; but the Time will never come, when he will be favourable no more. Let your Faith feed upon theſe Thing.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:41523:38"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Beware of renouncing your ſhare in that Grace which God hath encourag'd you to claim.</hi> Refuſal of Divine Comforts is a Sin, as well as Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Holy Motions.'Tis almoſt a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Miſtake (ſays Dr. <hi>Sibbes</hi>) to think that God delights in ſlaviſh Fears. 'Tis a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing Thing to him, to have his Kindneſs call'd into Queſtion, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>I have loved you ſaith the Lord, yet you ſay, wherein haſt thou loved us?</hi> Therefore give not Place to the Devil, nor the unbelieving Suggeſtions of your own Hearts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Attend to the Love-viſits of Chriſt, and thankfully receive them.</hi> The Spouſe ſmarted by grievous Doſertion, fro delaying to open to Chriſt when he knockt at her Door, <hi>Song</hi> 5.1, — 6. <hi>When our Beloved comes into his Garden, we muſt not neglect the holding of converſe with him.</hi> We may loſe him a great while, if we put by ſuch an Opportunity once.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Avoid all Confidence in the Fleſh, as a fatal hinderance to ſpiritual Joy.</hi> No wonder, if we hear God ſay, <hi>I have n delight in you,</hi> when we have fond Conceits of our own Performances. That Houſe which ſtands upon the weak Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a perſonal Righteouſneſs muſt needs be ſhaken with perpetual Doubts, and the fall of it at laſt will be great. We might Fear eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day, the Heart of God being turned to hate his People, if their Hopes of abiding in Favour with him were built upon the beſt of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Take heed of ſpotting your Garments with the Fleſh, after God hath been ſpreading his Skirt over you.</hi> Sinning againſt Love and Light at once, is a double Aggravation. It was a foul blot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Solomon, That his Heart was turned from the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41523:39"/>Lord God of Iſrael, who had appeared unto him twice,</hi> 1 Kings 11.9. 'Tis reaſonable to expect that you ſhould not defile your ſelves any more with your deteſtable Things, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.23. If any part of your Walk be contrary to God, 'tis worſe, than if the whole Walk of other Men be ſo</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>As you deſire an increaſe of Comfort, make daily progreſs in a courſe of Obedience.</hi> If you covet a greater fulneſs of Joy, labour after an higher Exerciſe of Grace. God required more exactneſs in the Services of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were come to their reſt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> than when they were harraſs'd in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.8, 9. So you who look for extraordinary <hi>Love tokens from God,</hi> muſt remember, that he calls for great Improvements from you. <hi>An abundant entrance into the Kingdom of Chriſt is miniſtred to Believers in a way of unwearied Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.11, with 5. The more ground we get, and the further we advance, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er likelihood there is of meeting with <hi>more of God.</hi>

               <p>IT is obſervable, that as none among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles was more uſeful and ſerviceable than <hi>Paul</hi> to the Intereſt of Chrit, and the Souls of Men, ſo the Devil did eſpecially labour to ſtain his Gredit, and to blaſt his Minſtry; and and even little Things, taht had nothing of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in them, ſuch as common Charity would have excus'd in any other Perſon, were malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly improv'd and perverted againſt him. We need to go no further than this very Chapter for an inſtance; there being an Imputation of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and falſhood caſt upon him, becauſe he had reſolved to come to this Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but did not. This was aggravated ſo far, as if he were one that ſaid, and unſaid, one that took no Care about the keeping of his Word, and that therefore no regard was to be had to any Thing that he delivered. In Oppoſition to this foul and groundleſs Charge, the Apoſtle makes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41523:40"/>an Apology and Defence for himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. Where he lets them know, that he was no ſuch fickle and unconſtand Man, as he was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; for his Intention of coming to them was real, though he was providentially obſtructed in performing it. And on this occaſion he alſo tells them, that his whole Doctrine had been uniform, and conſiſtent with it ſelf at all Times, without any Variations, or Contradictions, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. The courſe of his Preaching among them, being like the great ſubject of it, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God,</hi> who is not Yea at one Time, and Nay at another, but fixedly and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the ſame for ever, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. Now, as a convincing Proof of this, he adds in the Words of the Text, <hi>For all the Promiſes of God in him, are Yea,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The large Extent in which theſe Things are ſpoken of. [All]</hi> none excepted, but as many ſoever as there are, and of whatſoever kind they be, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, 1 Kings 8.56. <hi>There hath not failed one good Word,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Author of them. [God.]</hi> This ought to be eyed by us, becauſe the Infinite Power and immutable faithfulneſs of God are grand Encouragements to our ſteady Expectation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>To open ſomething of the Nature of Divine Promiſes.</hi> In five Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Promiſes of God are of a middle Nature, diſtinct from his Purpoſe and Performance.</hi> They come between the Decree, which is from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and the Execution of it, which is in Time. They are Significations of his Will, as a thing paſt, and fore-runners of the Event, as a Thing to come. When God promiſeth any Thing, it is before he does it, and after he hath determined it; we muſt ſuppoſe a praevious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and we may expect a following Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment. A Promiſe is the unfolding of the Heart of God, the communicating and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting of thoſe kind Thoughts which he thinks towards us, when he hath not yet fulfill'd them. It is impoſſible that God ſhould Promiſe any Thing, but what he hath rodain'd to be, and when it hath a real being, there is no need of any further Promiſe. God is willing firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his Love to us in Word, and then in Act; that while the Bleſſing he intends to beſtow, is but in the Way to us, and at a diſtance from us, we may Live in the comfortable Proſpect of it. A Promiſe is a Tranſcript of God's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and a Pledge of the Thing it ſelf. What he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41523:41"/>hath purpoſed, he ſpeaks; and what he hath ſpoken, he cannot go back from.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Promiſes of God argue much Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to us, but no Imperfection in him.</hi> God <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> himſelf, as it were, in making them, but he does not truly <hi>leſſen</hi> himſelf thereby. He ſtoops to the Infirmity of his Creatures, and yet the Honour of his own Majeſty is preſerv'd. In every Promiſe, 'tis true, that God makes himſelf a Debtor, but ſtill he remains our Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Superiour; for though the Promiſes be made to us, and for our Benefit, yet God does not owe any Thing to us, or for our ſake; the Debt is properly to himſelf, on the account of his own <hi>Fidelity,</hi> not to us on the account of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>That he abideth faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he cannot deny himſelf,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.13. 'Tis no debaſement of God to ſtand bound to his own Word, but 'tis below him to be under any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to his Greature. We cannot demand or claim the fulfilling of any Promiſe, as if the denial of it would be an injury and wrong to us, but becauſe it would derogate from his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and be unworthy of himſelf. This is what we have to faſten upon, and this hold is ſure enough.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The meer goodneſs of God is that which puts him upon promiſing.</hi> There was no Neceſſity of God's engaging himſelf to do any thing for us, though we were tyed to do our utmoſt for him; but his Engagements are Free and Voluntary, and ſpring from his own gracious Inclinations and Propenſions to us. God was at abſolute Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether he would enter into any ſuch Bond or not; ſuch a Liberty was eſſential to him as God; whereas a Creature muſt needs be under the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41523:42"/>Yoke, aſſoon as it hath any being. Every thing is due from us to God, whether we willingly oblige our ſelves to yield it to him or not; but there is nothing due from God to us, nor can we challenge the leaſt Thing more than he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly binds himſelf to. What God hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, we cannot look for; and even that which he hath promiſed, muſt have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd of alſo, if it had not been his good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to make thoſe Promiſes; for he promiſeth becauſe he will.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The goodneſs of God in Conjunction with his faithfulneſs, is his influencing Motive to perform the Promiſes which he bath made,</hi> Pſalm 57.3. <hi>God ſhall ſend forth his Mercy and his Truth.</hi> Mic. 7.20. <hi>Thou wilt perform the Truth to Jacob, and the Mercy to Abraham.</hi> This lovely Pair of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are a joynt Security to our Faith, that whatſoever God hath declared in his Word, ſhall be indeed accompliſht to us. The ſame Mercy which firſt moved God to expreſs ſuch kindneſs to us, is our warrant to believe that thoſe Expreſſions ſhall be made good to us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeeming difficulties and impediments lye in the Way. Everlaſting Mercy is our mighty ſupport in this Caſe, which we are to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Diſcouragement of our daily Sina. Theſe are the moſt likely Evils to hinder and withhold our good Things from us; but theſe Obſtacles are remov'd by Grace, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 65.3. <hi>Iniquities prevail againſt me;</hi> (but there is a Remedy for this) <hi>as for our Tranſgreſſions, &amp;c. Pſalm</hi> 65.3.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Promiſes of God are given forth for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to live upon.</hi> While they are in this World, they are the Pilgrim's Staff, whereon he is to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41523:42"/>lean and reſt, as long as he paſſeth the Time of his ſojourning here. They are the Wells of Salvation, from which we are to draw Water in a dry and thirſty Land. The Life which we live in the Fleſh, is not a Life of Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a Life of Faith, and this is the Food which God hath provided for the maintaining of that Life. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We are ſaved by Hope, but Hope which is ſeen is not Hope, for what a Man ſeeth, why doth he yet Hope for?</hi> Rom. 8.24. Heaven is the Place and State of ſight, here we are but <hi>Expectants;</hi> there they are in <hi>Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> but the preſent World is deſign'd for the Exerciſe of Truſt. God is to be our Confidence on this ſide the Grave, and our Portion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. <hi>Faith is the Subſtance of Things hoped for,</hi> Heb. 11.1. We are to look upon that as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which is in it ſelf Future.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>To enquire into ſome of the principal Kinds of Divine Promiſes.</hi> The Text ſpeaks of <hi>All,</hi> implying that they are manifold, and of divers ſorts: I ſhall take Notice only of what may be diſtributed under theſe ſix following Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There are Promiſes which concern the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World in general, as well as others which reſpect the welfare of thoſe who are choſen out of the World,</hi> Iſa. 54.9. <hi>This is as the Waters of Noah unto me; for as I have ſworn, that the Waters of Noah ſhould no more go over the Earth; ſo have I ſworn that I would not be wroth with thee,</hi> &amp;c. The Promiſe which God here refers to, is as ancient as the Floud; <hi>I will not again ſmite any more every living Thing, as I have done,</hi> Gen. 8.21. So, <hi>I will ſet my Bow in the Cloud, and it ſhall be for a token of a Covenant between me and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41523:43"/>the Earth,</hi> Chap. 9.13. This Promiſe of God is as a Fence or Bank to the World againſt a ſecond Deluge; but this hath its Ratification in Chriſt, for it was made upon God's ſmelling a ſweet Savour from <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sacrifice, which was Typical of Chriſt; and the Rain-bow it ſelf ſeems to be a Figure of him alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There are Promiſes which relate to the Church of Chriſt, as an Holy Society, as well as others that concern particular Believers,</hi> Mat. 16.18. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Rock I will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> Whether the Powers of Darkneſs acted by the Devil, or the Gates of Death and the Grave be here meant, it amounts to the ſame Senſe, the intendment of our Lord being plainly this, that he will have a Church in the World to the End of the World; it ſhall never totally periſh from the Earth, but be confirmed in ſpite of its greateſt Adverſaries, and ſurvive them all. This Promiſo, as it was utter'd by the Mouth of Chriſt, ſo it hath its Stability from him; for it becomes the Head to protect the Body, and to take Care that it be not deſtroy'd. He ſitting on the Throne is a ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard to his People, dwelling on the Footſtool.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There are Promiſes which belong to the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of them that believe, as well as others to their Perſons; for God receives, and takes in not only them, but their,</hi> Acts 2.39. <hi>The Promiſe is to you and to your Children.</hi> This is not to be taken ſo univerſally, as if all the Children of Believers were the Children of Promiſe; we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary often; many ſpiritual Men are afflicted with a carnal Seed; Grace is not tyed to a lineal deſcent in Religious Families, but only flows down where the Vein of Election runs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41523:43"/>the Promiſes are indefinitely laid down, and may accordingly be urg'd to God by his faithful ones, for thoſe that belong to them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 112.2. <hi>The Generation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright ſhall be Bleſſed.</hi> This hath its Eſtabliſhment in Chriſt, for as he was ſent to Bleſs, ſo little Children par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly were bleſt by him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There are Promiſes which have a Reference to Temporal Things, as well as others that refer to Spirituals and Eternals.</hi> This is ſuch a Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Apoſtle makes of them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Having the Promiſe of the Life which now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> Some Promiſes do more immediately concern the Body, others bear a Relation to the Soul; ſome reſpect Time, and others Eternity. Both ſorts have their Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Chriſt; only Temporal Promiſes are fulfilled with more Limitations and Reſtrictions, than the Spiritual are; becauſe Temporal good Things may not be always good for us, but when they are ſo, they ſhall be given. Yea, and in ſpiritual Caſes alſo, we muſt diſtinguiſh between what is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to Salvation, and what is not: For we may want ſome Degrees of Grace, and of Aſſurance, and yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe may ſtand faſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>There are Old Teſtament Promiſes, and New Teſtament Promiſes; which do not differ in regard of Matter</hi> (for they exhibite the ſame ſubſtantial Mercies) <hi>but only in regard of elder or newer Date.</hi> There were Promiſes which nouriſht the Faith of Believers before Chriſt's Time; <hi>Promiſes made unto the Father,</hi> which Chriſt was ſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. Promiſes which kept the Church alive, till Chriſt appear'd, we have all theſe, with the Addition of many more; we have Line
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41523:44"/>upon Line, Promiſe upon Promiſe, ſince the coming of Chriſt into the World; for the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Mercy are now more plentifully made known, and the Diſcoveries of Grace abound under the Goſpel Diſpenſation; but all this freſh Edition of Promiſes as well as the other, are founded upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>There are Promiſes which have been perform'd already, ſome perfectly, other is Part; and there are Promiſes which yet remain to be performed.</hi> The promiſed Deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> hath been accompliſht; the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo accompliſht in ſome meaſure, and the Detection and begun Conſummation of Antichriſt; but there are ſtill to come many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Things, which are ſpoken of the City of God: The National Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> a more eminent ſetting up of the Kingdom of Chriſt in the Kingdoms of the World, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing and beautifying of <hi>Sion</hi> beyond the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of fromer Ages, the total and final over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all her Enemies. As to every one of theſe, though yet only promiſed, we may apply that Voice from Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.17. And ſay <hi>it is done.</hi> That which is Future is ſecur'd upon the ſame bottom, as that which is paſt, was. Every Word of Promiſe from God, whether ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd or unfulfill'd, hath but one Center of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Why are Divine Promiſes ſaid to be ratified in Chriſt.</hi> Upon what accounts does the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here pronounce them <hi>Yea and Amen in him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For theſe ſeven Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt acts the Part, and Office of a Witneſs on the behalf of God, who is the Perſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing.</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:41523:44"/>God never left himſelf without a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the hath authorized and employed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in the ſeveral Ages of the World, to bear their Teſtimony to him, and his Bleſſed Truths; but he hath eminently and emphatically given Chriſt to be a Witneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4. Who does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably and infinitely excel al others; for he is ſtiled the <hi>Amen, The faithful and true Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Rev. 3.14. Yea, he is the Truth it ſelf; <hi>John</hi> 14.6. He teſtifies what he hath ſeen and heard with the Father; an Eye-witneſs, and an Ear-witneſs, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.32. An Honour which no Man could aſſume, but the Man Chriſt Jeſus who was in the beginning, and before the beginning with God, who was by him from Everlaſting, and know all that was in his Heart, when there was nothing utter'd by Word, or committed to Writing. He hath manifeſted the Fathers Counſels of Peace, and Commiſſioned his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to Report them. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.6. <hi>He ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, theſe ſayings are,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Surety of that Covenant, wherein all the Promiſes are comprehended.</hi> So he is expreſly call'd, <hi>Surety of a better Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 7.22. <hi>Or better Covenant, which is eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed upon better Promiſes,</hi> Chap. 8.6. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and engages for God, that all which he hath Promiſed ſhall be made good to us; he was that Angel of the Lord, that appear'd to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the burning Buſh, and ſaid to him, <hi>I am the God of thy Father, the God of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.6. He ſpeaks in his Fathers Name, and as a Perſon concern'd to ſee the Contract perform'd. Now as this general Promiſe of God's being our God, is the ſumm of the New Covenant, ſo all particular Promiſes are included in this; for if
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41523:45"/>God be our God, nothing cna be withheld by him, nothing can be wanting to us. And this new Covenant being Written (as it were) and Sealed with his Blood, we are not more ſure, that that Blood was really ſhed, then we are ſure that this Covenant will be punctually kept.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Perſon to whom the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are primarily made.</hi> As he is ſaid to be the <hi>Heir of all Things,</hi> Heb. 1.2. So is the firſt and chiefeſt Heir of Promiſe. <hi>The Promiſes were made to Abraham's Seed, which is Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.16. Many underſtand that Text of Chriſt My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, but I ſee not why Chriſt Perſonal ſhould be ſhut out. However other Scriptures evince the ſame Thing, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In Hope of Eternal Life, which God that cannot Lye, hath Promiſed before the World began.</hi> We did not then exiſt our ſelves, therefore it muſt be promiſed to Chriſt on our behalf, as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Head of the Election of Grace; for from him 'tis convey'd to us, and belongs to us, no otherwiſe than as we are one with him. Hence we read <hi>of the ſure Mercies of David,</hi> Iſa. 55.3. <hi>i.e.</hi> Of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle applies it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.34. See likewiſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.3, 4. where <hi>David</hi> is to be underſtood in the ſame Senſe. On this account he is ſaid to receive of the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt for us, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33. If God break Promiſe with us, he muſt be falſe to his Son.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the firſt and main Thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi> The moſt Ancient and Leading Promiſe had a direct Reference to him; <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents Head,</hi> Gen. 3.15. And when the Apoſtle had drawn up a Liſt of thoſe famous Worthies that Lived and Dyed,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41523:45"/>before Chriſt's Time, he ſays of them, <hi>Theſe all having obtained a good Report through Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd not the Promiſe,</hi> Heb. 11.39. There were ſeveral Promiſes which they did receive, and were poſſeſt of, but the Appearance of Chriſt in his incarnate State, which was the grand Promiſe; they liv'd not to ſee, but dyed in the belief of. Therefore when he came into the World, good Old <hi>Simeon,</hi> was ſo chearfully willing to leave it; <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant depart in Peace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.29. <hi>q. d.</hi> now I have ſeen the verifying of thy Word in this great Point, I have enough.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Promiſe of Chriſt was a Pledge of the Performance of all other Promiſes.</hi> In the Time of <hi>Ahaz.</hi> one of the worſt of King's, <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were Confederate againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> and God bids them not to fer nor be faint hearted, but reſt ſatisfied that they ſhould be deliver'd, and for their Encouragement, ſo as to put their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Deliverance out all Doubt, he gives them a Sign; <hi>viz, Behold, a Virgin ſhall conceive, and bear a Son, and ſhall call his Name Emmanuel,</hi> Iſa. 7.14. If your Faith can overcome this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, you cannot be tempted to call any thing elſe into Queſtion. God's Manifeſtation in Fleſh, and becoming Man, is the greateſt Thing, that can be lookt for: If this be done, nothing can be left undone. 'Tis impoſſible that any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhould be defeated, if this be accompliſht, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>How ſhall he not with him,</hi> &amp;c.?</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Execution of all Promiſes depends upon Chriſt's Purchaſe.</hi> Whatever is promiſed by God, is performed to us for Chriſt's ſake, as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe of its actual Conation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.6. <hi>That the Gentiles ſhould be Fellow-heirs, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41523:46"/>of his Promiſe in Chriſt, by the Goſpel.</hi> The Goſpel is the means of our Participation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Promiſes, but Chriſt himſelf is the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of all the good Things held forth in them. We enjoy nothing, but what his valuable Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings give us a Right and Title to. <hi>'Tis hy his Death that they who are called, receive the Promiſe of Eternal Inheritane,</hi> Heb. 9.15. Terefore the Covenant is ſtiled a Teſtament, which is of no Strength, nor can any of the Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed in it be demanded, except the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Dye, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.17. Though God be a free Promiſer with reſpect to us, yet all that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed is deſerved for us by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>All Promiſes iſſuing and proceeding from Love and Grace, muſt needs be ratified in Chriſt, and cannot without him.</hi> Promiſes are Expreſſions of Favour as threatnings are Revelations of Wrath. Now all the Favour which God ſhews to us, comes Streaming through Chriſt, 'tis <hi>the Love where with God hath loved him, which is in us;</hi> or exercis'd toward us, <hi>John</hi> 17.26. He is the firſt Object of Divine Love; <hi>the firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> and the firſt Beloved. <hi>The beloved, Eph.</hi> 1.6. If God ſhould look upon us out of him, we muſt be the Objects of his Hatred, and he could not ſpeak peaceably unto us. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proteſted to his Brethren, concerning <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> Gen. 43.3. <hi>You ſhall not ſee my Face, except your Brother be with you;</hi> ſo we could not have one Smile, or good Word, or Intimation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kindneſs from God, unleſs we had Chriſt to recommend us.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. <hi>How do theſe Promiſes ſo confirmed in Chriſt tend to the glorifying of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may be Opened two ways; By conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the tendency of them on his part, and on ours.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They tend to the glorfying of God on his part, who is the Author of them;</hi> and this in four re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects eſpecially:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As they tend to the glorifying of Chriſt the Mediator, who is ſo much concern'd and employ'd in the making of them ſure to us.</hi> He is had in Honour the more by this means; this renders him <hi>a precious Corner-Stone,</hi> as he is called, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. It heightens our Eſteem of him, as well as gives us encouragement to build upon him. Now whatever is to the Glory of chriſt, muſt needs conduce to the Glory of God; for God is in Chriſt, as he told the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> concerning

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Exaltation of Chriſt is to the Glory of God the Father, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11. And our Lord tells his Diſciples, when <hi>Judas</hi> was gone out with a purpoſe to betray him into the hands of his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, <hi>John</hi> 13.31. <hi>Now is the Son of Man glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and God is glorfied in him.</hi> The Glory of the Father, and the Glory of the Son are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed inſeparable; that which lifts up <hi>the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of his Perſon</hi> in the World, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily redound to hmſelf; as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Contempt which is caſt upon Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They tend to the Glory of God's Grace in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the Sovereignty and Amplitude of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They ſhew the Sovereignty of the Grace of God; that the ſhould make ſuch Promiſes to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to whom only Curſes and Threatnings belong.</hi> What marvellous Goodneſs in it, to over-rule all the Pleas of Juſtice and Judgment ſo far, that the <hi>promiſe of life in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1.) ſhould be given to Men that do nothing but what is worthy of Death! That God ſhould ſend ſuch <hi>good Tidings of great Joy</hi> to thoſe that could have look'd for nothing but flaming Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and implacable Fury! How plainly does this prove what he ſays, <hi>That he will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to whom he will be gracious?</hi> Exod. 33.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They ſhew the Amplitude of God's Grace;</hi> for if Grace did not abound, and flow out plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully from the Heart of God to us, we could never have had ſo large a ſtock of Promiſes as the Scripture ſupplies us with. There are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſufficient for every want, and ſuited to every condition; Promiſes of relief in every
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41523:47"/>Diſtreſs; of help againſt every infirmity; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Support in our Temptations, and of eſcape out of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. Certainly, If God had not been <hi>rich in Mercy,</hi> we ſhould have been more ſparingly provided.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They tend to the Glory of his Truth.</hi> This evidently appears by his bringing to paſs what he hath promiſed. The Word of God being verified in his Works, ſo conſtantly and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually as it is, is a convincing Inſtance and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his Fidelity. If God did never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the doing of us good, the luſtre of this Attribute would very much be loſt, though the un-promiſed Good ſhould be done. If God ſhould give us <hi>Grace and Glory,</hi> without telling us before-hand, that he will, how ſhould we know him to be the <hi>true and faithful God</hi> by the giving of it? The <hi>Promiſe</hi> is as the <hi>Orb,</hi> in which this Perfection of God ſhines forth. The <hi>Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> of God are thoſe <hi>immutable things</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>in which it is impoſſible for God to lie,</hi> Hebr. 6.18. The Exact Accompliſhments of theſe things are ſo many clear Demonſtrations of that <hi>impoſſibility,</hi> Pſal. 89.34. <hi>My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing which is gone out of my lips.</hi> If he could have changed or violated his Word, he is provok'd enough to do it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>They tend to the Glory of his Power.</hi> God is tyl'd <hi>able to do above all that we can think,</hi> Eph. 3.20. and indeed many of the things which God hath promiſed, are ſuch as could not have entred into our hearts <hi>to conceive.</hi> Much of that which God hath made the matter of our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, does exceed our Imagination; and yet we can think a great deal more than we can do, or more than any other Creature can. This
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41523:48"/>therefore magnifies the Power of God, and ſhews the length and ſtrength of his Arm beyond the utmoſt capacities of Angels and Men. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil indeed frequently promiſes, not only more than he intends to perform, but more than he is able to perform if he would. He told our Lord, when he ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the World, <hi>All theſe things will I give thee;</hi> whereas he could not really give him the ſmalleſt ſingle Thing out of theſe all; inſtead of givng him the whole of what he ſaw, he could not give him one Foot of the ground on which he ſtood. But on the other hand. God cannot Promiſe more than he can Perform, though he performs ſometimes more than he hath poſitively promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They conduce to the Glory of God on our Part, who believe them; for we glorifie God by Believing more than by Working, more by receiving the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe than by fulfilling the Command.</hi> Though Faith and Obedience are by no Means to be ſet in Oppoſition (for Obedience ſprings from Faith) yet have the Preference; Compariſon, Faith is to have the Preference; God hath ſet the Royal Crown upon the Head of Faith and made her Queen inſtead of Works. No Sin ſo great a reproach and diſhonour to God as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; no Grace or Duty that brings in ſuch a Tribnte of Glory to him, as our believing in his Word. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. <hi>He</hi> (Abraham) <hi>ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerd'd not at the Promiſe of God through unbelief but was ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory to God.</hi> The ſtronger the Faith, and the leſs mixtures it hath of infidelity, the more Glory reſults to God: This is manifeſt in two Things. The Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which are conſirm'd in Chriſt, are no the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41523:48"/>Glory of God, when receiv'd by us: Becauſe</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith is a Subſcription of the Soul to them.</hi> The doing of the Words of the Law is call'd a Confirming of them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. Becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, every Tranſgreſſor of the Law does as much as in him lies, to diſanul and make it void. So Faith in the Promiſe is as it were our Confirmation of it; and full Agreement to it. As on the other ſide, to disbelieve the Promiſe, is to Abrogate and Cancel it, as far as we can. Here lies the Blafphemy of Infidelity; <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a Lyar,</hi> one not fit to be Credited, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. <hi>But he that receives his Teſtimony, ſets to his Seal, that God is true,</hi> John 3.33. There is a double Seal to the Foundation of Divine Promiſes. The Seal of God's unchangeableneſs, which he puts to it, and the Seal of a Believers firm Perſuaſion and Conſent, which is to be affixt by us. So God declares his Promiſes to be <hi>Amen,</hi> and we alſo by Faith put our <hi>Amen</hi> to them; here is <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> ours as an Eccho to God's; for our <hi>Amen</hi> ſigniſies not only deſire of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but Aſſurance; not only ſo be it, but ſo it ſhall be. Of this we have an Example, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith includes a Dependance of the Soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi> Hence <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>My Fleſh ſhall reſt in Hope,</hi> Pſalm 16.9. That Hope which is grounded on the Word, gives reſt to the Soul; 'tis as an Anchor to keep it ſteady, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13. Which ſhews the ummoveableneſs of that which our Anchor is faſten'd to. The Promiſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains our Faith, and our Faith is that which ſupports us. He that Hopes in the Word, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.81. laies a mighty ſtreſs
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41523:49"/>upon it; as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did, when he leaned upon the Pillars of the Houſe, ſo as pull it down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> A Believer throws the whole weight of all his Affairs and Concernments, Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, like a Man reſolved to ſtand or fall with them. He ventures himſelf and all that belongs to him, entirely upon this bottom, which is in Effect to ſay, if they will not bear me up, I am Content to ſink; I know that there ſhall be a Performance of thoſe Things which have been told me from the Lord, and therefore I will inceſſantly look for it.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. This Doctrine may be improv'd by way of Information and Exhortation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Information.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>All that's enjoyed out of Chriſt, is only in a Courſe of common Providence, not by Vertue of any Promiſe; becauſe all the Promiſes are Yea and Amen in Chriſt. They that are without Chriſt, are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Covenant of Promiſe,</hi> Eph. 2.12. In a Chriſtleſs State, they have no more to do with them, nor can receive any more Benefit by them, than the Devils themſelves, who are not only reſerv'd to Judgment, but are partly under Execution. Carnal Men have very often a large Portion of this World; <hi>God brings into their Hands abundantly,</hi> Job 12.6. <hi>He fills their Houſes with good Things,</hi> Chap. 22.18. But as the Holy Ghoſt ſays of the Hearts of ſuch Men, ſo it may be ſaid of the beſt of their Enjoyments, they are little worth. They are but miſerable Comforts, becauſe they are not given on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Promiſe; therefore given in Wrath,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41523:49"/>and not in Mercy; with a Curſe, and not with a Bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Legal Promiſes are out of Date, and quite Excluded.</hi> There are no Promiſes in force, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> what are in Chriſt. And therefore no Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes but what are Evangelical; for though Chriſt came to fulfil the Precepts of the Law, he came to eſtabliſh the Promiſes of the Goſpel; <hi>Do and Live</hi> is the Promiſe of the Old Covenant, but this is deſtroy'd and taken away in Chriſt; and he that attempts to live by doing, builds up what Chriſt deſtroy'd. The Law was indeed Publiſht in its full Perfection to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but it was with a gracious Deſign of ſubſerviency to the Goſpel, by leading them to Chriſt; that being ſenſible of their own inability to keep the Law, they might fly to him, and take Sanctuary in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Righteouſneſs and compleat Obedience. The Law is abus'd, when ſet up to the vacating or weakening of the Covenant of Grace. <hi>Paul</hi> rejects this with abhorrence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Is the Law then againſt the Promiſes of God? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Promiſes of God are not founded upon the Performances of the Creature; for then they would not be to his Glory by us, ſo much as to our Glory by him.</hi> The Ancient Believers obtained Promiſes through Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33. And ſo muſt we. And indeed this is the cuſtomary Scripture-way of expreſſing this Matter, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>That we might receive the Promiſe of the Spirit through Faith,</hi> ver. 22. <hi>That the Promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> Now whatſoever is by Faith muſt needs be purely of Grace; without the leaſt reſpect to any worthineſs in the Object. God does not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41523:50"/>ſuppoſe Qualifications in us, but work them; and thoſe very Promiſes which are conditionally propounded, as to the Manner of delivering them, are abſolutely perform'd to thoſe that are intereſted in them; for the ſame God gives both Repentance and Pardon, Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Happy State of a Believer is unalterably ſure.</hi> Pſalm 125.1. <hi>They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</hi> The Reaſon is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Covenant and Promiſe of God, which is all their Salvation, and all their Support, can never be removed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.10. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our own Threatening Infirmities, here is Matter of ſtrong Confidence. Grace in us is weak, Corruption oftentimes gets the upper hand, our Hearts are deceitful, the Tempter is very buſie; but none of theſe Things ſhake the Perſeverance of the Saints; though they ſhould awaken our Caution, and perſuade our Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, they ſhould not move us from our Hope; becauſe that Word of God is ſettled in Heaven, which concerns our Settlement and Security here on Earth. He who requires us to ſtand faſt, hath promiſed that we ſhall do ſo; and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are not ſuſpended upon uncertain Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may fail, but they have their full Ratification in Chriſt, who is always the ſame: <hi>A Sun of Righteouſneſs without any Shadow of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Though a Believer may be ſtript naked and bare of all his outward Things, he cannot be robb'd of his trueſt Riches;</hi> he ſtill really abounds when he ſuffers the greateſt need: For his moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Wealth (as well as Life) is hid with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41523:50"/>Chriſt in God, the Promiſes of God being all confirm'd to him in Chriſt. Upon this account, though he be utterly emptied of every Thing in this World, that properly belongs to the World, he may juſtly ſay, nevertheleſs, I have all, and am full. The Teſtimonies of God are a goodly Heritage, and the rejoycing of the Heart in the Total Deprivation of External Comforts: This will explain that Paradox of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. <hi>As having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all Things;</hi> though we have nothing in Hand, yet we have all Things in hope; what we want in Poſſeſſion, is infinitely made up by Promiſe. To have our Portion of Goods in our own Hands (as the Prodigal had) is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, we may ſpend it or loſe it; but to have a Stock in God's Hands is ſafe, 'tis a Treaſure which faileth not. <hi>The Poor of this World have a bleſſed Recompence, if Rich in Faith;</hi> James 2.5. In this Caſe, good Bills and Bonds, which will all be paid, whenever there is occaſion, are a far better Eſtate than ready Money, which Private or Publick Thieves may break through and Steal from us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Special Ordinances are ſpecial Priviledges.</hi> The Preaching of the Word is an Ordinance that lies open and common to all, and this is a conſiderable Priviledge; for how ſhould Men be brought to believe without the Word of Faith? But Sacraments which are limited and confin'd in their Adminiſtration to ſelect peculiar Perſons, are much more conſiderable, being ſenſible Signs for the Confirmation of our Faith, when it is wrought in us. Among the many Advantages which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of Old had above all other People, the Apoſtle reckons up the Covenants
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41523:51"/>and the Promiſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. I do not know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thing to the contrary, but that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants there may be meant of the two Seals of the Covenant under the Old Teſtament, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and the Paſſover (to which we have our correſpondent Seals under the New Teſtament) for Circumciſion particularly is called, not only a Token of the Covenant, but the Covenant in their Fleſh, who were Circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. Now all Sacraments are viſible Promiſes, God holds forth to our very ſight, what may ſerve for the Encouragement of our Faith, and the directing of our Hearts to Chriſt on whom we Believe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Come to God in Chriſt for the Performance of his Promiſes to you.</hi> Two Things lye in this one.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Plead the Promiſes with God, lay hold of them, and humbly challenge your ſhare in them.</hi> Put him in remembrance of what he hath ſaid, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.49. <hi>Remember thy Word unto thy Servant,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.26, 27. <hi>Thou art God, and haſt promiſed this goodneſs to thy Servant, now therefore let it pleaſe thee to bleſs,</hi> &amp;c. Do not ſay, what have I a Sinner to do with the Promiſes of Grace: Thou haſt a ſufficient warrant from the free offer of God's Grace in Chriſt, and the expreſs Command of God to believe. 'Tis thy Duty to comply with his Invitation, and rely on his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Acceptance. 'Tis no Preſumption in the filthieſt Soul that ever was, to urge God with his good Word, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.29. <hi>I will ſave you from all your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſſes.</hi> If the Promiſes do not belong to thoſe that ſee themſelves undone,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41523:51"/>and are under a Senſe of their unworthineſs to receive any help, they belong to none.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Plead them in Chriſt, or elſe your Prayers will miſcarry, and the Promiſe never be performed to you.</hi> Take heed of having an Eye to ſelf, or of imagining that they ſhould be made good to you for your own ſake. An excellent Author, <hi>(A. Burgeſs)</hi> calls this an Ivy-ſin, which ſticks ſo cloſe to our Natures, that it ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes and devours All, look to Jeſus if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſpeed. Expect not that God ſhould ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to any Prayer, in which we have not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chriſt, as the only Perſon in whom the Promiſes are <hi>Amen.</hi> This I take to be the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Senſe of that Propheſie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.15, 16. <hi>The Lord God ſhall call his Servant by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name, that he who bleſſeth himſelf in the Earth, ſhall bleſs himſelf in the God of Truth;</hi> viz. <hi>in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider Chriſt as the true Foundation of your own Stability.</hi> Read the Words following the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. As the Promiſe of God have their Eſtabliſhment by Chriſt, ſo we alſo are eſtabliſhed in him. We ſtand by Faith, and our Faith ſubſiſts by the Power of Chriſt, or elſe it will fail the very next Moment, after it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, Chriſt dwelling in our Hearts, is the Strength of our Hearts; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Rooted, and built up in him, and ſtabliſht in the Faith,</hi> &amp;c. They that ſeem to be Pillars, are but ſorry Reeds without him, which every wind of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will bend or break. The ſame glorious Power which upheld him in the working out of your Redemption, muſt likewiſe ſuſtain you in the Exerciſe of Faith upon him; or elſe you will quickly Experience your ſinful weakneſs by a miſerable Fall.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:41523:52"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Set a juſt value upon the Promiſes of God, as unchangeable Aſſurances of his Love and Grace.</hi> Remember how much greater the Teſtimony of God is then the Witneſs of Men, and therefore receive it with anſwerable Joy. We read of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>great and precious Promiſes being given unto us.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. They are ſo in themſelves, and ſhould be ſo to us. Men of all Degrees are Vanity and a Lye, of doubtful and uncertain Credit, and we cannot depend much upon what they ſay; they often out-live their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and grow weary of performing them, or if not, yet their Promiſes dye with them, and then what are we the better? But we cannot prize any Divine Promiſe more than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, becauſe we can never be deceiv'd by them in any of our Expectations from them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Let no appearing impoſſibilities make you Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion God's Accompliſhment of any of his gracious Words.</hi> Though you cannot ſee how the Thing can be done, 'tis enough, if God hath ſaid, that he will do it. There can be no Obſtructions to promiſed Salvation, which we need to Fear. He who is the God of this Salvation, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Promiſe, will prepare his own Way for the doing of his own Work, ſo that <hi>every Valley ſhall be filled, and every Mountain and Hill brought low,</hi> Luke 3.5. Though the Valleys be ſo deep, that we cannot ſee the bottom, and the Mountains ſo high that we cannot ſee the Tops of them, yet God knows how to raiſe the one, and level the other, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.1. <hi>I that ſpeak in Righteouſneſs</hi> (or faithfulneſs) <hi>am mighty to ſave.</hi> If any Thing would keep back the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, it would be our Infidelity; but he will come, though he ſhould find no Faith on the Earth. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:41523:52"/>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Cast not away your confidence becauſe God defers his performances.</hi> Though Providences run croſs; though they move backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, you have a ſure and faithful Word to rely upon. Promiſes, though they be for a time, ſeemingly delay'd, cannot be finally fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. Dare not to harbour ſuch a thought within your ſelves, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.8. <hi>Doth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe fail for evermore?</hi> The Being of God may as well fail as the Promiſe of God; That which does not come in your time, will be haſtned in his time, which is always the <hi>more convenient ſeaſon.</hi> Accuſe not him of ſlowneſs, who hath ſaid, <hi>I come quickly, i.e.</hi> he comes as ſoon as all things are ready and ripe for his appearance. 'Tis as true, <hi>that the Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. as that he is never guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of breaking his Promiſe. Wait therefore, how long ſoever he tarry, do not give over ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting; the Heart of God is not turn'd though his Face be hid; and Prayers are not flung back, though they be not inſtantly anſwer'd.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>You who are in Christ, take Example from the Promiſes of God.</hi> You are under the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many ſolemn Promiſes made to God, Wo be unto you, if you do not look to a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diligent performance of them. See <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.13. You have entred into a ſacred Oath, and conſequentially into a dreadful Curſe, if you do not according to that Oath. Remember <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Reſolution, and imitate his practice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106. <hi>I have ſworn, and I will perform it, &amp;c.</hi> You who have Vowed conſtant Service and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to God (as you have done, if you own any Relation to him) beware of violating that Vow, and let it be in the thoughts of your hearts for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41523:53"/>ever. How ſhould unſtable Souls be ſhamed out of their un-even Walkings, by the ſtrict engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in which they ſtand, and by the Pattern which an immutable God hath ſet before them! Surely his Truth and Firmneſs to us ſhould be a ſtrong. Argument againſt our being looſe and wavering from him. What can we think of our ſelves, that God ſhould be ever mindful of his Covenant, and we yet remain ſo unſtedfaſt in it? Let us therefore this day reſolve once more, and to better purpoſe than hitherto, in the ſtrength of Chriſt, that we will improve God's Promiſes for the faſtening of our own; hia gracious Promiſes to the binding of our righteous Promiſes, that in whatſoever things we have opened our Mouths to the Lord, we may not by contrary acts make our tongues to fall upon our ſelves.</p>

               <p>IT is moſt manifeſt from ſeveral Paſſages in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> that it refers to a Time of great Diſtreſs and Deſolation in general, though what particular Time is here pointed at, is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly Conjectur'd, and indeed after all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains uncertain. There is one Requeſt for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of this calamitous Caſe, which is thrice Repeaed, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 7, 19. in the former Part of which Requeſt, there is a kind of Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſerv'd, every Time 'tis mention'd, <hi>Turn us again Oh God; turn us again Oh God of Hoſts; and turn us again Oh Lord God of Hoſts;</hi> but the latter Part is ſtill the ſame, and no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made in the Repetiton; <hi>Cauſe thy Face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But yet there is no Petition throughout the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41523:54"/>or that ſeems to carry ſuch an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Senſe in it, as that in the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Explication, there are Three Things to be enquir'd into.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Who is intended here by the Man of God's right Hand, and the Son of Man,</hi> &amp;c? Some think, it ſignifies the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the whole Common-Wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times collectively ſpoken of, as one Man, and a ſingle Perſon; others take it for the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and Royal Family, or for the Stock and Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> out of which our Lord was to ſpring; but the Characters here given do much better agree to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> himſelf, if we duly conſider them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Man of thy Right Hand.</hi> This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports one highly favoured and reſpected by God; as <hi>Benjamin,</hi> which is a Son of the right Hand, (and named, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.) was his Father's darling. The right Hand is a beloved Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as is intimated by the Command to Cut it off, <hi>if it offend,</hi> Mat. 5.30. So is Chriſt pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly dear to God, his Delight and Joy from Everlaſting, and exalted to ſit at his Right Hand; a Place too great for any Creature, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Son of Man.</hi> This is a Title moſt frequently given to Chriſt in the Goſpel, and in the Old Teſtament alſo, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13. <hi>I ſaw in the Night-Viſions, and behold one like the Son of Man,</hi> &amp;c. Which denotes the Truth of Chriſt's Humane Nature, though he came not by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Generation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>One made ſtrong by God for himſelf.</hi> As <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>The Branch which thou madeſt ſtrong for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41523:54"/>thy ſelf.</hi> Now, as Chriſt is often call'd the Branch by the Prophets, ſo he was really fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht and endued (as Mediator) with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Power to ſerve the great Purpoſes and Deſigns of God, ſuch as could have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by no other. And ſo it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that he ſhould be, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right Hand of my Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What is meant by the Thing requeſted, let thy Hand be upon,</hi> &amp;c. If we conſider ſome other Places where the like Phraſe is uſed, we ſhall find, it implies Influence, Protection and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; as <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.31. <hi>The Hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the Hand of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I went in the heat of my Spirit, but the Hand of the Lord was ſtrong upon me;</hi> the Prophet being then under a mighty Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Impreſſion, beyond what other common Perſons were, or even he himſelf at other Times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How are we to underſtand the Connexion of this Petition with the following Words, ſo will not we go back from thee.</hi> It may be underſtood two Ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As it would oblige them to the yielding of ſtedfaſt. Obedience;</hi> it would lay them under a ſpecial Engagement never to Revolt any more, as they had done; if God would grant this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, it would be a moſt eminent Tye and Bond upon them to the moſt conſtant and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Service.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As it would enable them to yield ſuch Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And this I conceive to be chiefly aimed at; if God would lay ſuch help upon Chriſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41523:55"/>for them, they ſhould receive Power by that means to diſcharge their Duty to him better than ever heretofore; though they were very feeble and wavering, falſe and treacherous of themſelves, yet here would be a ſucceſsful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
               <p>Note 1. <hi>The Conſideration of Jeſus Chriſt is very fit and proper to Miniſter Comfort and Relief in the moſt afflicted Condition.</hi> That State of the Church which this <hi>Pſalm</hi> hath a Relation to, was very deplorable, but they encouraged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by looking to the promiſed Saviour. When their Vineyard was burnt with Fire, and cut down, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. They had an Eye to him that was the true Vine, whom God exerciſes ſuch Care and Husbandry about, that his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and uſeful Fruit can never be deſtroy'd, <hi>John</hi> 15.1.</p>
               <p>Note 2. <hi>It was the commendable Practice of the Church in the Old Teſtament Times to Pray for Chriſt:</hi> This was according to the Precept; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72.15. <hi>Prayers ſhall be made for him continually.</hi> They pray'd for his Aſſiſtance in his Work, and for his actual Miſſion to perform it; that he might be ſent into the World, and that what he undertook might proſper in his Hand. Nor is the Duty now out of Date, of Praying for his ſecond Coming, for the Advancement of his Intereſt, and Enlargement of his Kingdom here below. But the main Scope of the Words, will lead us to another Point.</p>
               <p>Obſ. <hi>The Strength of Chriſt is the great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Security of Believers againſt Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from God.</hi> Here,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41523:55"/>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. Shew wherein lies the true Nature of this Apoſtacy.</item>
                     <item>II. Of what Concernment it is to Believers to be ſecur'd againſt it.</item>
                     <item>III. How is the Strength of Chriſt their Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this Caſe.</item>
                     <item>IV. Why hath God order'd it ſo to be.</item>
                     <item>V. Uſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Wherein lies the true Nature of Apoſtacy from God.</hi> The very Expreſſion whereby the Holy Ghoſt does here deſcribe and ſet it forth, will, if duely weighed, give us ſome Light into it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Every failure and defect in the Exerciſe of Grace, is not to be reckon'd as an Apoſtacy.</hi> There is a great Difference between ſpiritual Decaies and Languiſhings, and this going back from God. The Soul may faint and flag in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of God, and yet not be carried off ſo far, as to ſteer a contrary Courſe. <hi>As a Schiſm in the Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.25. Is much leſs than a Separation from the Body; a breach or diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a Church, not ſo much as an abſolute Rent and dividing from a Church, ſo there may be Declenſions in our Obedience, and yet no declining from the Law, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.51. The Degrees of Grace may be remitted, when the actings of Grace are not deſtroyed; and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of Grace weakened, when they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed. As the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> did not ceaſe to Love, yea even in Sincerity, though charg'd with leaving her firſt Love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. Chriſt ſays, he had <hi>ſomewhat againſt her,</hi> which is a diminiſhing term, but he would have had
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41523:56"/>much more againſt her, if inſtead of an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Love, it had been turned into hatred. Theſe gradual Deficiencies and ſhrinkings of Grace, are truly humbling to us, and may iſſue worſe, if not carefully lookt after; we have Reaſon to lament them, and endeavour a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Cure of them; but ſuch a revolting from God, as the Text ſpeaks of, if more than all this comes to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Every poſitive Diſcovery of Corruption in the actual Commiſſion of Sin is not Apoſtacy.</hi> A Man may halt and ſlip, yea he may ſtumble, and fall, and yet not go back. He that reſolvedly holds on his way, may notwithſtanding oftentimes, through Ignorance or Infirmity turn aſide out of it, before he finiſhes his Courſe. A Believer may be led into Captivity to the Law of Sin, and yet never properly is brought under the Reigning Power of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. compar'd with 7.23. To be violently ſeized by another as an Enemy, is a very diſtinct thing from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to another's Dominion, as a Lord. A Subject may continue Loyal to his Rightful Prince, though the Arms of a wrongful Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per may for a Time prevail againſt him. A voluntary Transferring of my Allegiance, is much more than to be taken Priſoner by force. Rebellion is an aggravating Addition to Sin, <hi>Job</hi> 34.37. Now Apoſtatizing in Scripture is very frequently expreſt by Rebelling, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.29. <hi>God forbid that we ſhould Rebel againſt the Lord, and turn this Day from following the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.5. <hi>We have done wickedly and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by departing from thy Precepts,</hi> &amp;c. Every Offence againſt a Law is not an Act of Treaſon, or Renunciation of the Soveraign Authority.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41523:56"/>All Sin is a Tranſgreſſion, but this Sin of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding is <hi>the great Tranſgreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Apoſtacy from God includes not only a Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in the Life, but an Alienation of the Heart.</hi> Not only a ſinful wandering, but a loving to wander, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.10. <hi>Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their Feet.</hi> So long as the Heart is right with God, it cannot be ſaid that the Man goes back from him. An unwilling Departure, is not ſo much the Act of the regenerate Perſon, <hi>as of the Sin that dwelleth in him,</hi> Rom. 7.17. No outward Performance, good or bad, does denominate ſo much as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward frame and working of the Spirit. A great many miſcarriages will be graciouſly overlookt in the viſible Walk and Converſation, when there is a cleaving to God with full Purpoſe of Soul. The Errors of a Man's way are far more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, than erring in Heart. The Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom God was ſo much griev'd with, <hi>were a People that did err in their Hearts,</hi> Pſalm 95.10. Though there be no manifeſt or groſs backſliding in the Life, yet if there be a revolting and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Heart, there is the poyſonous Root of all Abomination. Here is Apoſtacy in the ſight of God, though not in the ſight of Men; as the <hi>Iſraelites in their Hearts turned back again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Egypt, when they were marching in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Acts 3.39. According as the Mind is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrang'd from God, or keeps cloſe to him, a Man is clear or guilty in this Caſe. <hi>Our Heart is not turned back,</hi> was the Church's Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 44.18.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Apoſtacy from God, is really an undoing of all the good which we have done.</hi> 'Tis a wicked Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance quite contrary to the Grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41523:57"/>as that is a Repentance from dead Works, ſo is this a Repentance from Works of a better ſort, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36.3. <hi>He hath left off to be wiſe, and to do good.</hi> 'Tis a Perverſion to Evil after a ſeeming Converſion from it. The firſt Apoſtacy wherein all are involved, ſuppoſes the Creation of Man in a State of Uprightneſs; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one is gone back,</hi> Pſalm 53.3. Therefore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> Original Courſe was a walk with God. So here, the Apoſtacy whereof we ſpeak is a miſerable change for the worſe, after a plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. change (at leaſt) for the better. There can be no going back, but where a Man hath once run well; <hi>No looking back, but where a Man hath firſt ſet his Hand to the Plaugh,</hi> Luke 9. <hi>ult.</hi> 'Tis ending in the Fleſh, after we have begun in the Spirit; when our Faces have been towards <hi>Sion,</hi> and our doings framed to turn to God, this is a revoking and diſanulling of all, and driving towards Hell. 'Tis a Declaration of War, where we have pretended Friendſhip; 'tis a ſaying in Effect, the Time paſt ſufficeth us to have wrought the Will of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now we will Work our own. In ſhort, 'tis no leſs than our pulling down all that we have built up, and a liſting of our ſelves in the Service of Sin and Satan, whom we have fought againſt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Of what Concernment and Importance it is to Believers to be ſecur'd againſt ſuch Apoſtacy.</hi> This will appear from two Things; their Danger <hi>of</hi> Apoſtacy, and their Danger <hi>by</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How much they are in Danger of it,</hi> viz. <hi>If left alone, and abandon'd to themſelves.</hi> There are Three Conſiderations which will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41523:57"/>ſhew the greatneſs of this hazard.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Grace in us is very weak.</hi> The Apoſtle does not ſay, be ſtrong in the Grace which is in thy ſelf, but <hi>in the Grace which is in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.1. That fulneſs of Grace, of which Chriſt is the ſubject, can never be leſſen'd, but thoſe meaſures of Grace which are communicated unto us, and lodg'd in us, might and would be loſt, if we were ſeparated from him. Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Abilities will fail, if not continually recruited and ſupplied. All created inhaerent Holineſs, of it ſelf is a periſhable Thing; 'tis indeed made of God an abiding incorruptible Seed in Believers now, but 'tis not ſo in its own Nature. If it were, how could the Angels in Heaven, or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in <hi>Paradice</hi> have ever fallen? Grace is a good Treaſure in the Heart, but it wants Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſs to guard it; as there is no World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling who thinks, that his Bags or Coffers can defend themſelves. Gracious Habits are the true Riches, but they lye open for Thieves to rob us of them; except God keep our Houſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath furniſht it, Poverty will come upon us like an armed Man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Corruption in us is very Active.</hi> We are very apt and ready to be drawn away by our own Luſt, <hi>James</hi> 1.14. <hi>There is Folly enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the wiſeſt and beſt of Men to pervert and miſlead them.</hi> He was no ordinary Saint, who complain'd of his being <hi>ſo fooliſh and ignorant;</hi> that he was <hi>as a Beaſt before God,</hi> Pſalm 73.22. There is ſtill too much Brute in him that hath attain'd to be more than a Man. None of us are ſo waſhed from our ſilthineſs, while we are in this World, but that the Reliques of a ſwiniſh Principle in our Natures would make us
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41523:58"/>return to wallow in the Mire, if God did not keep us back. If we conſider how juſt <hi>Lot</hi> lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd in going out of ſinful <hi>Sodom,</hi> we cannot but think, that he would have lookt behind him, as well as his Wife, except thoſe Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been reſtrain'd. Though our Hearts be Circumcis'd to Love God predominantly, there are vile Affections ſtirring in us ſtill, not very eaſie to be ſuppreſt. The Law in our Members is not like a dead Letter, but a lively Principle, which Wars againſt the Laws of our Minds.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Temptations which come againſt us, are very numerous.</hi> Every Place, every Condition, every Employment, every Relation is full of them. 'Tis hard to avoid being aſſaulted by them, 'tis harder many Times to eſcape being overcome. Whereſoever we are, we find our ſelves, like the Prophet in <hi>Dathan,</hi> 2 Kings 6.14. <hi>Compaſs'd about with a great Hoſt.</hi> Every Friend of God hath many Adverſaries always beſieging him, and often ſolliciting and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſeduce him from his Obedience to God. <hi>When Solomon was Old</hi> (and when one would have Thought, he ſhould have been the more confirm'd in the pure Religion) <hi>his Wives</hi> (who were therein the Inſtruments of Satan) <hi>turned his Heart after other Gods,</hi> 1 Kings 11.4. The Devil manages his Point with ſo much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, as even to make uſe ſometimes of ſincere miſtaken Chriſtians to Hand his Suggeſtions to us; as <hi>Acts</hi> 21.4. When <hi>Paul</hi> by a Divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe was going up to <hi>Jeruſalem, there were ſome Diſciples who ſaid that he ſhould not go;</hi> through the Spirit they knew what he would ſuffer there if he went; and as carnal Men, they diſſuaded
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41523:58"/>him from it. The Old Man within, and Old Serpent without us, make it very difficult to keep our Way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How much danger they incur by Apoſtacy, if they ſhould be left to be guilty of it.</hi> Three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars will give us a ſufficient diſcovery of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They muſt needs at the preſent, loſe all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Communion with God.</hi> How can they that go back from him, have any Enjoyment of him? How can they that go out from the Preſence of the Lord, ſuppoſe that his Preſence ſhould follow them in their degenerate Courſe? Muſt not he that turns his back upon God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it the natural Fruit of his won Ways, if the Face of God be hid from him? <hi>The Lord is with you, while you be with him,</hi> 2 Chron. 15 2. But if we forſake our own Mercies, do we imagine, that they will not alſo forſake us? God's backſliding Children have ſadly Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc't the Truth of this, by lying long under their Father's frowns; he hath ſuſpended the ſweet Manifeſtations of himſelf, and they have not known where to find him, even after they have come to themſelves again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They can never ſee the Kingdom of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they remember from whence they are gone back, and return and do their firſt Works.</hi> While a Man is in a Road of Apoſtacy, he is quite out of the Way to Heaven, and 'tis impoſſible ever to reach the End, without returning into the Way. None are further off from the Kingdom, then they that once ſeem'd to be the neareſt to it, and afterwards Revolt. None more hateful to God, than ſuch as have once expreſs'd much Love; as a Prince is moſt provoked by thoſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41523:59"/>that firſt appear very zealouſly for him, and then turn maliciouſly againſt him. God hath ſaid, <hi>If any Man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no Pleaſure in him,</hi> Heb. 10.38. God will never endure ſuch an one to ſtand in his ſight, that dare to quit and renounce his Service, after the hath been for a ſeaſon employed in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If they come back to God again,</hi> (as undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly they will, if evey they were truly Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him) <hi>it muſt be by very bitter and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Repentance.</hi> With what Indignation does the Apoſtle ſpeak, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Shall I take the Members of Chriſt, and make them the Members of an Harlot?</hi> And is there not as much Cauſe for the ſame Holy Indignation againſt a Man's ſelf, after he hath done ſo? The Caſe is the ſame as to all others Sin's of ſuch a kind, which are more than common Defilements. When backſliding <hi>Iſrael</hi> was about returning, <hi>The Voice of Weeping was heard upon their high Places,</hi> Jer. 3.21. How plentifully ſhould we ſow in Tears, when like thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> we have been ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering our Ways to ſtrangers! How ſhould we ſit in the Duſt, go ſoftly, be covered with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and lye down in our Shame, in the Senſe of what we have done, when we have done ſo wickedly! He that can paſs over a foul Apoſtacy with little remorſe and ſleight Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, is under a Deluſion, if he think that God hath graciouſly receiv'd him.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>How is the Strength of Chriſt our Security in this Caſe?</hi> Anſwer in five Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Omnipotence belongs to Chriſt, on the account of his Godhead, and this ſhall be exerted on the behalf of them that believe, as there is occaſion,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:41523:59"/>Prov. 8.14. <hi>I have Strength.</hi> They are the Words of Chriſt, who is brought in ſpeaking under the Name of Wiſdom. It is not meant of any created, borrowed Strength, ſuch as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are ſaid to excel in, but infinite eſſential Strength; the Strength of God, for he is God. <hi>The mighty Angels are his,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.7. made and govern'd by him, to wait upon him, and Miniſter to him; but he himſelf hath a nobler and greater Character, <hi>The mighty God,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. Yea, <hi>the Almighty,</hi> Rev. 1.8. The <hi>Almighty Son</hi> of an <hi>Almighty Father,</hi> yet not another, but the ſame <hi>Almighty God;</hi> a diſtinct Perſon inveſted with all the glorious Properties of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Here lies the Argument which Chriſt himſelf uſed, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. <hi>None ſhall pluck them out of the Father's Hand, becauſe he is greater than all;</hi> and conſequently <hi>none ſhall pluck them out of Chriſt's Hand, becauſe he and the Father are one.</hi> The Strength is equal, becauſe the Eſſence is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt was anointed with Power, as Mediator, the Improvement whereof is not to his own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but the Advantage of thoſe that believe in him. He that travail'd in the greatneſs of his Strength, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf Mighty to Save,</hi> Iſa. 63.1. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read of God's <hi>raiſing up an Horn of Salvation for us,</hi> Luke 1.69. An Horn inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates Strength; Chriſt is a mighty Saviour, and our Salvation is the End and Scope of his being ſo. <hi>He had a Spirit of might reſting upon him,</hi> Iſa. 11.2. Great and ſingular Abilities for his ſpecial Work communicated to him, and the Fruit of all redounds to us. Hence he is call'd <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> the ſtrong <hi>God with us,</hi> not only ſo in himſlef, but as our Redeemer; as 'tis
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41523:60"/>ſaid in the Caſe of the Deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was figurative of a greater and more excellent Deliverance; <hi>their Redeemer is ſtrong,</hi> Jer. 50.34.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt hath deſtroy'd the Power of the Devil, by a Power Superiour. to him</hi> This is meant by his dividing the Spoil with the ſtrong, Iſa. 53.12. Snatching of poor Captive Souls as a Prey out of the Teeth of the Devourer, which being once reſcued, are never given up again. The Devil was the ſtrong Man armed, that kept his Palace, and his Goods were in Peace, but our Lord who was ſtronger than he, came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and overcame him, and took from him all his Armour, wherein he truſted, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21, 22. None but Chriſt the Prince of Life, was able to do ſuch Execution upon the Prince of this World, whoſe Slaves and Vaſſals we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are. But this being done, by Vertue of Chriſts Victory, we alſo ſhall be finally Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious. Satan would have deſpis'd our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Oppoſition, if the Son of God had not foil'd him firſt; now we may deſpiſe his. Our Triumphant Friend hath left us a Conquer'd Enemy to deal with; ſo that through him ſtrengthening us, we may tread down Strength.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt by the matchleſs Efficacy, and Merit of his Blood hath purchas'd for us Confirming Grace, and the perpetual Preſence of the Spirit with us.</hi> Not only our acceſs into that Grace <hi>wherein we ſtand,</hi> but our ſtanding in that Grace wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we have Acceſs, <hi>is by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 5.2. He hath engag'd poſitively, that the Spirit ſhall not only be given to us, but abide and dwell with us, <hi>John</hi> 14.16, 17. And he hath engag'd for nothing, but what he hath effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41523:60"/>The Sufferings of the beſt of Creatures are weak and worthleſs; but the Death of Chriſt is of ſuch Infinite force, as to make it impoſſible for any one whoſe Sins he hath dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, to dye in Sin, <hi>By one Offering he hath perfected for ever them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. We have deſerv'd to fail of the Grace of God, he hath deſerv'd the Continuance of it; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be as Chaff which the Wind drives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Chriſt hath deſerved that we ſhould be as Mount <hi>Sion, which cannot be removed.</hi> His Blood is that which Anſwers all Things.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſts prevailing Interceſſion ſecures to us the needful actual ſuccours of Grace, while we are here in this World.</hi> There is a great deal which depends upon this; <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt ſuch as come to God by him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them.</hi> Chriſts Everlaſting Interceſſion is mention'd as the Reaſon of Chriſts Ability to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt. Indeed all Chriſts Pleadings are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible, God can deny him nothing which he asks; therefore he is called by the Name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 49.3. A Name which was given to the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> upon the ſucceſs of his wreſtling with the Angel; for it may be more eminently applied to Chriſt, what was ſaid of him, <hi>That by his Strength he hath Power with God, Hoſ.</hi> 12.3. Chriſt produces his ſtrong Reaſons which the Father cannot but hearken to. So that if he Pray for <hi>Peter,</hi> that his Faith may not fail, it is impoſſible that it ſhould. If he Pray for our being kept, we cannot be loſt.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. <hi>WHy hath God order'd it ſo, that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhould be ſecur'd againſt Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by the Strength of Christ?</hi> The Reaſons of the Divine Will in this Caſe, may be ſuch as theſe Six following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This agrees with God's general Deſign of heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Glory poſſible upon Jeſus Christ.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſuch Honour and Majeſty laid upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Creature, nor was indeed fit to be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any, as was laid upon Jeſus Chriſt. This was a Part of the Meſſage which the Angel brought to his Virgin-Mother, concerning the <hi>Son whom ſhe was to conceive and bear, He ſhall be great;</hi> Luke 1.32. He was that Son of Man, whom God reſolv'd peculiarly to magnifie, and advance above all, That all ſhould be beholden
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41523:61"/>to him, and have their Dependance on him. <hi>I will ſet him on high, ſays God,</hi> Pſalm 91.14. He ſhall be the Head of my Family in Heaven and Earth; he ſhall be as the firt-born among many Brethren; I will give him an univerſal Preheminence, and put all Things in a State of neceſſary ſubjection: He ſhall be the <hi>Joſeph</hi> to whom every one's <hi>Sheaf ſhall bow down,</hi> and whom all in my Houſe ſhall be nouriſh'd by, and receive their ſubſiſtence from, This was the Glory which the Father determined from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to give to Chriſt, to make him the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable Center of the whole Creation of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10 <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ; &amp;c.</hi> that nothing ſhould be firm or ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but what is brought into him, The Tenure of all the Good that we enjoy, is therefore in Chriſt, <hi>In the Lord have Irighteouſneſs and Strength, Iſa.</hi> 45.24. What we have <hi>in</hi> Him, we hold <hi>by</hi> Him alone; What is given for <hi>his</hi> ſake, is ſecur'd by <hi>his</hi> means, that he may be every way glorious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This ſuits with God's Deſign of Grace in our eternal Election; for we are choſen in Christ, Eph.</hi> 1.4. Therefore 'tis ſit that we ſhould be alſo <hi>preſerv'd in Christ, Jude</hi> 1. God's chuſing of us, is a giving of us to Chriſt; 'tis often expreſt ſo in Scripture; and therefore who ſo fit to be their Security, as he to whom they are given? Chriſt hath the Chriſt hath the Care of all whom the Father chuſes, and he is to give account of them at laſt. They are committed to him, and will be demanded from him, and therefore where ſhould ſtength be lodg'd for their ſupport and eſtabliſhment, ſo properly as with him? <hi>John.</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the Father's Will who hath ſent me, that of all which he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41523:62"/>hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again,</hi> &amp;c. to prevent their being finally loſt. God gives 'em to Chriſt; this is God's End and Aim; but how ſhall the Loſs be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, except we have Strength and Stability from Chriſt, whoſe <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Trust</hi> we are? That God's Foundation might <hi>stand ſure,</hi> he lays his own Son for a Foundation; Every Stone in the Building reſts upon Him, or elſe there would be no difference between them and thoſe that are out of the Building; for he muſt keep thoſe that are in it from dropping out. It would have been a vain thing to conſtitute Chriſt the Head of God's Elect, if God had not alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that the Elect by his Influence, ſhould be inviolably maintained to the very laſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>'Tis neceſſary that we ſhould be ſccur'd against Apostacy by the strength of Christ, becauſe he is the First and the Last in our Sanctification.</hi> He ſtiles himſelf <hi>the Beginning and the End, Rev.</hi> 21.6. So he is not only in himſelf, but with reſpect to the Work of Grace in us; He begins it, and compleats it, <hi>the Author and Finiſher of our faith, Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>i.e.</hi> The Firiſt Author and Finiſher of it. Now 'tis impoſſible that he ſhould be ſo, without being our Eſtabliſher and Preſerver all the time between. From the <hi>First</hi> to the <hi>Last</hi> we muſt be upheld by him, or elſe all that is wrought in us will quickly come to nothing. If he do not ſtrengthen his own work, it will be ſoon deſtroy'd tho' it be his own, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.28. <hi>Stengthen, O God, that which thou bast wrought for us.</hi> Another Hand is not able to preſerve what his Hand produces. The beſt Beginnings will have the worſt Endings, if any thing leſs than the Power of Chriſt have the Management
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41523:62"/>of them. So that Chriſt will loſe the Glory of our begun Sanctification, unleſs he undertakes for our ſetled Confirmation; and he never will have the Honour of our perfected Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except he enables us to hold on in the way that we have enter'd.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>'Tis neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould ſecure us in our Way to Glory, becauſe 'tis his Buſineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us into the Poſſeſſion of that Glory at the cloſe of all.</hi> John 14.3. <hi>If I go and prepare a Place for you, I will come again, and receive you to my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. The Reception of departing Souls to Heaven at Death is the Act of Chriſt, and ſo is the Sentencing of them to an Eternal Abode in Heaven at the general Judgment. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that Day,</hi> &amp;c. But who ſhall there be to wear this Crown, if Chriſt do not keep them in the way of Righteouſneſs, till that Day comes? <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them on the Right Hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. But where will any ſuch Perſons be found, if abandon'd by Chriſt, while they are here in this World? This is to be the Portion of Chriſt's Sheep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but the Wolf will have ſcatter'd them all, if he do not defend them, before that Time. There will be no Heirs to this Inheritance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he that bought it for them, take Care that they may not alienate it from themſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Wiſdom of God is hereby ſeen in a moſt ſhameful baffling of the Devil.</hi> Though all the Poſterity of the firſt Man are utterly weaken'd and diſabled by Sin, yet the Man Chriſt Jeſus is become a Fountain of ſpiritual Strength to his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41523:63"/>own Seed. The Devil Triumpht over the Old <hi>Adam,</hi> as having caſt down many wounded in the foiling of that one; but here is a ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> aſſuming the very ſame Nature, that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over him, and helps us to Triumph alſo. Fleſh and Blood was conquer'd by him in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi> but here is a Partaker of Fleſh and Blood, that puts him to flight. Though Man alone could not grapple with him, but fell by his firſt aſſault, yet God-man hath bruis'd him under our Feet, and given us a firmer ſtanding. The Devil muſt now pull down the Banners which he had ſet up; becauſe his Head is broken by the Woman's Seed. One that once dwelt among us, in ſuch an Houſe of Clay as we do, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd us from him, and fortified us againſt him. Though he gave us a Mortal blow in our firſt Parents, here's the Son of Man hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd us again, and is the Strength of our Life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Believers could not have a better Security, than that whereof there hath been a viſible Experiment in the Perſon of Chriſt himſelf.</hi> His Strength is a tryed Strength; if it had not been enough for us, it had failed him; but if it ſuſtained him in ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a Work againſt ſo much Reſiſtance both from Earth and Hell, we cannot fear its falling ſhort. Chriſt had a Work upon his Hands, that all the Angels in Heaven could not have done; and yet he went through it. Chriſt was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all Points like as we are, and a great deal more than we are, yet the Tempter could faſten nothing upon him. He never flinch't from what he undertook, but purſued his firſt Engagement, till all Things foretold concerning him had an End. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.5. <hi>The Lord God hath opened my Ear, and I was not Rebellious neither turned away
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41523:63"/>back.</hi> He went on, though there was a Lion in his Way, the Roaring Lion, yea though God himſelf came forth with his drawn Sword of Juſtice, as an Adverſary againſt him, for our ſakes. This may give us the more Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to believe, that he can and will keep us alſo from going back.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. Several Things are to be learnt as Truths, and urg'd as Duties from this Doct.</hi> Some Things for the informing of Judgment, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for the directing of the Practice.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Information.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What a wretched Caſe muſt they be in, that are out of Chriſt?</hi> The Apoſtle calls them unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Souls, that are eaſily beguil'd; and how can they be otherwiſe? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. The Devil does with them as he will, carries them whither he pleaſes, for there can be nothing to hinder him, where the Power of Chriſt does not reſt upon their Perſons. Such as partake not of the Root, that do not derive a Vertue from thence, are like dead Branches, or wither'd Leaves, which may hang on for a Time, but will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be blown off by ſome Wind or other. Hypocrites that are in Chriſt by outward Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion only, are like Meteors which glitter and blaze a while, but they are ſoon ſpent, and tumble to the ground; but the Stars in Chriſts Right Hand (<hi>Rev.</hi> 1.16.) cannot do ſo. They that belong to Chriſt, have their Preſervation from him, but 'tis no wonder to hear that all others miſcarry. <hi>Thoſe that thou gaveſt me, I have kept, and none of them is loſt, but the Son of Perdition,</hi> John 17.12. And this Son of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41523:64"/>was none of them; not given in order to Salvation, but Apoſtleſhip. That goodneſs which Chriſt does not eſtabliſh, muſt needs be as a Morning Cloud; no Creature can eſcape a fall that ſtands upon its own Bottom. All counterfeit Graces, plauſible Duties, fair Shews, and falſe Joys, will vaniſh and come to nothing, becauſe the Perſons whoſe they are, are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Chriſt, and have no Strength or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port by him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This diſcovers the Reaſon of the Difference which there is oftentimes between one Believer and another.</hi> Their Strength is not in themſelves but in Chriſt, and from him it is variouſly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and diſpens'd, according as he ſees good. Hence it is that they who have obtain'd like precious Faith, are not equally ſtrong in Faith; and they that are riſen up to greater Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come ſhort ſometimes as to ſpiritual Acts. Some that have been beſt furniſht with the Habits of Grace, have at particular Seaſon been moſt defective in the very Exerciſe of Grace, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray more than others of their own Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Weaker Chriſtians have done better, in reſiſting of ſome Temptations, than ſuch as have been a great deal ſtronger. The Women that followed Chriſt (though the weaker Veſſels) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not Chriſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, though a more eminent Diſciple; for though Chriſt pray'd, <hi>that his Faith might not fail,</hi> he did not Pray that he might not faulter. It was ſaid to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, Thou haſt a little Strength, and haſt kept my Word, and haſt not denied my Name,</hi> Rev. 3.8. The weakeſt Chriſtians will ſtand with Chriſt help, and the ſtrongeſt cannot ſtand without it.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:41523:64"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This ſhews how there comes to be ſuch a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and inequality in the ſame Believer at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Times.</hi> Sometimes he withſtands a greater Temptation, and at other Times is foil'd by a leſſer; becauſe no Man, not the beſt of Men prevails by his own Strength, but according as Strength is given out from Chriſt to ſuccour and aſſiſt him. One while <hi>David</hi> is got up ſo much above carnal fear, that nothing can ſhake him; he encourages himſelf in God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>that he ſhall not be greatly moved,</hi> Pſalm 62.2. Yea, not moved at all, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time, he is ſo overwhelm'd with horror, ſo ſunk and diſpirited, as if there were no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to ſhield him, and therefore cries out for the <hi>Wings of a Dove, that he might fly away from</hi> the reach of his Enemies, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 55.5, 6. The ſame <hi>Soul follows hard after God, when his right Hand upholds it,</hi> Pſalm 63.8. Which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards flags, and is almoſt ready to give over following, when that right Hand is withdrawn.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This lays open the ground of the Devils En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt Chriſt, which hath been always moſt extream and implacable.</hi> He knows, that he ſhould eaſily compaſs his Ends upon Belivers, if Jeſus Chriſt did not ſtand in the Way. All the Powers of Darkneſs were furiouſly bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Perſon of Chriſt, becauſe the great Strength of all that belong to him, lies in him. If they could have conquer'd him, no Member of his could ever have ſtood againſt them. The Deſtruction of the Head would have been the Deſtruction of the whole Body; as <hi>when the Philiſtines ſaw that their Champion was dead, they all fled immediately,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.15. All God's Jewels and peculiar Treaſure are laid up and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41523:65"/>kept in the Hands of Chriſt, ſo that the ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him (if it had been poſſible) would have been the ſeizing of all at once. What an Exedrciſe hath Chriſt undergone for our ſakes, in bearing both the Wrath of God and the Rage of Hell, when he might have avoided both, if he had not deſign'd to be a Refuge, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert from both to us!</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The State of thoſe that are in Chriſt is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amended and improved ſince the Fall, beyond what it was before.</hi> Never was better Tidings brought to the World, than that; behold I make all Things new. Men are given to change, and often change for the worſe; but God's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations are always to Advantage. The New Teſtament Diſpenſation mightily excels the Old; the latter Days will out-ſhine and out-do the former Times. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.17. <hi>For Braſs I will bring Gold, and for Iron I will bring Silver, and for Wood Braſs, and for Stones Iron.</hi> That which comes in the room of what is done away, is ſtill of a more valuable Kind. The ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is better than the firſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> more glorious than the firſt. Sinful Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd, is in a better Condition, than innocent Man as he was Created. A poor Believer is ſtronger in Chriſt, than the holieſt Angels without Chriſt; for without Chriſt no Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Perſeverance, but in him there are, and ſuch as cannot be broken. <hi>He will not turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from us, we ſhall not depart from him,</hi> Jer. 32.40.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>'Tis inexcuſable Folly for any one in the World to lean to his own Arm.</hi> As the Holy Ghoſt ſays, <hi>that Vain Man would be wiſe,</hi> i.e. 'tis an inſtance of his Vanity, that he will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41523:65"/>to ceaſe from his own Wiſdom; ſo the Pride of our Hearts makes us very unwilling to ſuſpect our own Strength, or to caſt away all Confidence in it. This Pride does not only go before Deſtruction, but is the Cauſe of it; Man would be a God to himſelf, his own Saviour, and Defender, and in thinking himſelf ſo, he is his own Deſtroyer. Nothing does more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually Ruine us, than the Conceit that we can recover or preſerve our ſelves from Ruine. It is ſuch kind of Preſumption which ſlaies its Ten Thouſands; if Men were more ſenſible of their own Infirmities, and diſtruſtful of their own Abilities, the Devils Kingdom would be empty in Compariſon of what it is. To ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that we can do any Thing without Chriſt, is the way to undo the Work of God already done. If Adams perfect Holineſs was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, while he was left alone, how ſhould ours be ſo, which is imperfect?</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Everlaſting Strength muſt fail, before any true Believers can Everlaſtingly Miſcarry.</hi> I ſay, before any can; for if any one may periſh, all may; becauſe it is the ſame Strength which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures all. Unleſs the Lord's Hand be ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no Soul can ever be pluckt out of it. The Honour of Chriſt is concern'd and indeed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to ſee every Child of God brought ſafe to Heaven; and therefore they may do well to conſider what Reproach they caſt upon Chriſt, who (by their Doctrines of Apoſtacy) make believers walk with him, (as one ſaid) like ſorry Dancers on a Rope, that are every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in danger of breaking their Necks. Is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſuch a ſtrong Helper, and yet may the Gates of Hell prevail againſt thoſe that are
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41523:66"/>joyned to him? Hath he pawn'd his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Word, that the good Part ſhall not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from thoſe that have once choſen it; <hi>Luke</hi> 10.42. And ſhall Men that turn the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel upſide down, repreſent it as a doubtful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Portion? Is Grace no better than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gifts, and outward Bleſſings? That we may be totally diſpoſleſt of the one as well as the other? Nothing can more derogate from our Bleſſed Lord, or expoſe him worſe than this ſcandalous Opinion does, as a feeble incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Undertaker.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Exhortation.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Beware of falling from your own ſtedfaſtneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.17. This is proper and pertinent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to thoſe whoſe Strength is in Chriſt, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Principles breed an Holy, not a Carnal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Watchfulneſs and Diligence, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and Caution, are neceſſary in our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Walk; for they that lay theſe Things aſide, do thereby Declare that they have nothing to do with Chriſt, nor any Intereſt in the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I have been ſpeaking of. They are wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully miſtaken, who think that infallible Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes render all Exhortations fruitles: The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God teaches otherwiſe; 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27, 28. <hi>Ye ſhall abide in him; and now, little Children, abide in him.</hi> How abſurd is it to ſuppoſe, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Perſeverance in Grace, ſhould make Men do ſuch Acts as are contrary to Grace, and deſtructive of it! Or that we ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore live in the neglect of Means, becauſe we are ſure to perſevere in the uſe of them! This is ſuch kind of Divinity, as the Devil's was, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.6. <hi>He ſhall keep thee,</hi> therefore hazard thy
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41523:66"/>
                  <hi>his Angels ſhall bear thee up,</hi> therefore <hi>caſt thy ſelf down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Be not utterly diſmayed, when Satan hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any Advantage of you, through your ſinful Weakneſs.</hi> Be duely affected with, and ſuitably abaſed for, the leaſt Departure from God, but do not let go your hold of Chriſt, as if you were irrecoverable. Say not, as the Church in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity did, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.18. <hi>My Strength and my Hope is periſhed from the Lerd.</hi> This is a very falſe and unjuſt Concluſion, not warranted by the Word of Grace, but a meer Artifice of the Devil. When he tempted you to Revolt, he would alſo urge you to deſpair of a return; but though you have complyed with him in the one, ſtand it out againſt him in the other, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.14. <hi>The Lord upholdeth all that fall,</hi> &amp;c This ſeems a Paradox indeed, for how ſhould they fall, if he upholds them? <hi>Anſ.</hi> He up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds them ſo far, that they ſhall not utterly ſink, and he will take Care to raiſe them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; do not reckon your ſelves deſtroy'd, tho' caſt down; <hi>The ranſomed of the Lord may be carried Captive into a Land of Enemies, but they ſhall return and come to Sion with Songs, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Joy upon their Heads,</hi> Iſa. 35.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Take heed of ſcornful or cenſorious deſpiſing of weaker Brethren.</hi> If he that deals to every Man his meaſure of ſpiritual Strength, hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded more to you, and leſs to ſome others in the World, do not lift up your ſelves above them. <hi>Boaſt not againſt the Branches</hi> (thoſe that are inferiour to thy ſelf) <hi>for thou beareſt not the Root, but the Root thee,</hi> Rom. 11.18. If Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt were not more liberal to you, than to them, your Soul would be in their Soul's
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41523:67"/>Caſe. Judge not thoſe who are upright in their Hearts, though they do err in leſſer Points; the Holy Ghoſt ſays, they ſhall be hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up, for God is able to make them ſtand, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Trample not upon them that are moſt bowed down with a Spirit of Infirmity.</hi> There is a reſpect to be paid to God's halting <hi>Jacob's,</hi> and his Lame <hi>Mephiboſheths.</hi> The greateſt and the leaſt of Saints are both depending Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore ſhould carry themſelves with all Modeſty and Meekneſs one towards another, <hi>He who eſtabliſheth us with you in Chriſt, is God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.21.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Make no Promiſes of Perſeverance in your own Strength.</hi> Learn the contrary of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt in the Text, who firſt makes his Requeſt, <hi>Let thy Hand be,</hi> &amp;c. Then expreſſes his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <hi>So will not we,</hi> &amp;c. If we Vow continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Chriſt in all Temptations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to pay what we Vow, we muſt not Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our ſelves capable of Payment without Aſſiſtance from Chriſt. No Man hath Grace enough to be his own Keeper, or to execute any Purpoſe of that ſort, unleſs he be ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving more Grace from Chriſt's Fulneſs. A Thing well reſolv'd, is half done; but we can never reſolve well, unleſs we do it in the Strength of Chriſt. <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.5. <hi>We will walk in the Name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.</hi> A Phraſe which does at once import two Things, that ſhould go together, attendance on God's Service, and reliance on his Power.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Look to your Faith, as the principal Grace, which contributes to your Eſtabliſhment.</hi> Iſa. 7.9. <hi>If you will not believe, ſurely you ſhall not be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</hi> The contrary is implyed, <hi>If you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41523:67"/>you ſurely ſhall be.</hi> The Scripture ſays more than once, <hi>That by Faith we ſtand,</hi> Rom. 11.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. Which is more than is any where ſaid of any other Grace, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is evident,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe Faith is the uniting Grace, and 'tis <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt, which is the ground of our Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis the receiving Grace; that whereby we do not only receive Chriſt himſelf, but all from Chriſt; and 'tis by Vertue of Strength receiv'd, that we are able to ſtand.</hi> This is the Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we do not only receive from Chriſt at firſt, but whereby we muſt be receiving from him all along; <hi>for we renew our Strength by waiting upon God,</hi> Iſa. 40. <hi>ult.</hi> Which is a Scripture-Phraſe for Faith and Patience together. It is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of thoſe whoſe Strength is in God, that their Strength is ſtill increaſing; <hi>they go from Strength to Strength,</hi> Pſalm 84.5, 7. But without Faith, there's no ſuch Bleſſedneſs to be had, the Unbeliever hath no Strength but what is in himſelf; a meer ſeeming Strength, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a periſhing declining Strength; for from him that hath not, what he ſeems to have, ſhall be taken away.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Exerciſe Faith upon Chriſt eſpecially in Times of great Temptation and general Defection</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think to ſtand long, if you ſtand looſe from Chriſt; but keep your hold of him, and ſtick cloſe to him, and then you will be able to ſtand faſt, and having done all to ſtand, whatever aſſaults are made upon you, whatever Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are committed by others, continue touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and Vertue will ſtill come out of him. Make your Neſt in this Rock, when the Devil
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41523:68"/>blows with his Wind; when <hi>Paul</hi> was buffeted with the Meſſenger of Satan; he beſought the Lord that it might depart, and though that was not immediately granted, yet he had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſatisfactory Anſwer, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee, my Strength,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9. If it be a Time wherein the Faith of many is Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt and overthrown, Holy Truſt in Chriſt will be an Anchor to the Soul, ſure and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. When many of Chriſts Diſciples went back, and he put the Queſtion to them, <hi>Will you alſo go away? Peter cryes Lord to whom ſhall we go? (to whom beſides thee?)</hi> John 6.66, 67, 68.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Do not arrogate the Honour of your ſtanding in Chriſt, and abiding with Chriſt, in the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to your ſelves.</hi> Let Chriſt have all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your ſetting out, and holding out; let him have it now, and let him have it at the Laſt. Aſcribe all to him, who is able to keep you from falling, who alone could do it, and hath done it, <hi>Jude</hi> 24.25. Chriſt is the Perſon there meant, for the Preſentation of Believers faultleſs in the great Day belongs to him. Say to him, <hi>Lord by thy Favour thou haſt made my Mountain to ſtand ſtrong, which elſe had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd and carried away long ſince; thou haſt made me a Pillar in thy Temple, elſe I had waver'd and gone out again, as well as others.

               <p>THE Perſon whom theſe Words concern, was the Twelfth of thoſe Judges, from whom this Book receives its Name, as being the Hiſtory of the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> during their ſucceſſive Adminiſtrations. He was one that had an extraordinary Preſence of God with him, which ſtirr'd him up to, and made him ſucceſsful in very great and wonderful Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. So we read, <hi>That the Spirit of the Lord began to move him,</hi> Chap. 13.25. <hi>And came mightily upon him,</hi> Chap. 14.6. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.14. The firſt Miſcarriage, whereby he forfeited his Priviledge, was his Converſation with the Harlot at <hi>Gaza,</hi> and yet God was pleas'd by his ſpecial Aſſiſtance to let him eſcape the Danger which that Sin brought him into, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3. of this Chapter. The ſecond Debauchery prov'd more fatal; <hi>viz.</hi> the letting out of luſtful Affections to <hi>Dalilah,</hi> a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41523:69"/>Woman in the Valley of <hi>Sorek,</hi> ver. 4. This Sin was followed with others, as the telling of three deliberate repeated lies, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 11, 13. And at laſt conſenting to the Violation of his ſolemn Vow as a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> by the ſhaving of his Head, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. One would think from the diſcovery of ſuch an important Secret, that he had been bereaved of common Prudence, when there were ſuch plain Reaſons to ſuſpect a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious Deſign; but ſo God rightly order'd, that the Folly ſhould be a Puniſhment of the Sin, and that both ſhould make way for his further Suffering. For aſſoon as this was done, <hi>his Strength went from him,</hi> ver. 19. His Strength ſeems to be a peculiar Gift to him, which was to be continued upon the Condition of keeping his Hair uncut, and ſo that Condition being broken, this Gift was recall'd. Yet the ſtrange Preſumption and Stupidity of <hi>Smpſon</hi> after all this, may be Matter of Aſtoniſhment to us; of which we have an Account in this 20th <hi>ver</hi> When <hi>Dalilah</hi> comes to rouſe him with the uſual Cry, <hi>The Philiſines are upon Thee.</hi> See
<list>
                     <item>1. His Preſumption, <hi>He awoke out of his Sleep, and ſaid; I will go out as at other Times before, and ſhake my Self]</hi> How could he imagine this, when he himſelf had ſaid, that if he were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he ſhould become Weak, and like another Man? How could he expect to do as he had done, when he had ſo poſitively foretold his own Fate? Therefore</item>
                     <item>2. See his Stupidity; <hi>[And he wiſt not that the Lord was departed from him.]</hi> He ſaid what he did, upon a ſudden, at his firſt awaking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he found how he was betray'd; beſore he perceiv'd that his Locks were cut off, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41523:69"/>he conſider'd what the Conſequents of that would be. He was not inſtantly apprehenſive of the Miſery of his Caſe, through God's juſt abandoning of him, but depended on the ſame Aſſiſtance which he had formerly receiv'd, till he felt the contrry by woful Deſertion. It is a lamentble Truth which theſe Whords do teach us, but yet a Truth which is proſitable to be known.</item>

               <p n="1">I. <hi>What are thoſe Departures of God from Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, which they are lyable to, and ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd with?</hi> There are Three Things, which muſt be diſtinctly enquir'd into, with Reſpect to this Point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What are they as to the Kind?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Not a Loſs of the Favour of God,</hi> Pſalm 89.33. <hi>My Loving Kindneſs will I not utterly take from him,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis brought in with a neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, after he had ſpoken of the viſiting of Tranſgreſſion with the Rod, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. God's ſharpeſt Corrections for Sin are no Arguments of his Alienation from the Perſon; when his Hand goes forth with moſt Severity againſt us, his Heart may be ſtill towards us as much as ever. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.10. <hi>The Mountains ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but my Kindaeſs ſhall not depart from thee.</hi> The Mountains are the moſt ſolid and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Parts of this lower Creation, yet they may and ſhall be remov'd, they may by violent Eruptions be carried into the midſt of the Sea, they ſhall be overturn'd at the End of the World; <hi>but the Love of God is Everlaſting and Vnmoveable.</hi> Where 'tis once fixt, 'tis never to be taken away; <hi>neither Things preſent, not to come ſhall be able to ſeparate us from it.</hi> If the foreſight of our Sins did not prevent it, Sins actually committed, ſhall not diſplace it. If God bear ſuch a good-will to unbelieving Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (for the firſt fulſilling of the Work of Faith in us, is a Fruit and Evidence of his Love to us) we cannot reaſonably ſuppoſe that it ſhould afterwards ceaſe to ſinning Believers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis a withdrawing of the Spirit of God, not in Regard of real Freſence, but manifeſt Influence.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:41523:70"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The real Preſence of the Spirit is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, for this is conſtant and perpetual.</hi> Both its Conſtancy and Perpetuity I conceive to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. <hi>He dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> Where he once makes his abode, he always ſettles it; he is not an uncertain Gueſt, but a reſolv'd In habitant. Believers have the Spirit, when they cannot diſcern that they have him; for they would be no longer Believers, if they were without the Spirit. We muſt be cut off from Chriſt, if the Spirit ſhould be taken from us, for our Union with Chriſt is maintain'd and ſecur'd by the indwelling of the Spirit. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. <hi>Hereby we know that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</hi> This is a continued Priviledge, upon which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers depend; for we are no louger the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Lord Jeſus, than we are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The manifeſt Inftuence of the Spirit may be withdrawn; though his Reſidence be not alter'd, his Operations may be interrupted;</hi> in Three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as to <hi>Gifts, Graces,</hi> and <hi>Comforts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In Reſpect of Gifts.</hi> Theſe receive the Name of ſpiritual Giſts, not only from their Nature, but from the Spirit as the Author; for how various ſoeverthey be, they all flow from him as their common Fountain. <hi>There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.4. Now they that are poſſeſt of theſe Gifts will fſind them withering and decaying, and be as though they had none, when the Spirit of God withholds that actual Influence which gives Life and Vigour to them. With what ſtammering Lips do we ſpeak, when he is not with our Mouths! What poor ignorant Babblers are
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41523:71"/>we, when he does not enrich us in Utterance and Knowledge!</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect of Graces.</hi> As the Habits of <hi>Grace</hi> are infuſed, ſo the Actings of <hi>Grace</hi> are aſſiſted, by the Spirit, and the moſt ſtrong and lively Chriſtians are very feeble and languid, when he keeps back his quickening Helps. The being of Grace is the Effect of the Spirits plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſpringing of Grace is the Effect of his Watering. The choiceſt Vine will yield but ſorry Grapes (like the ſhrivell'd Fruits of a dry Tree) when God Commands the Clouds, that they do not Rain upon it. In ſuch a Caſe, though <hi>the Seed of God remain in a Believer,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>Yet what he bring forth, is always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In reſpect of Comforts.</hi> All Conſolation is the Work of the Spirit, which is certainly more or leſs, according as he affords or abates his Teſtimony. <hi>When he ſheds abroad the Love of God in the Heart,</hi> there is abounding Hope, and a full Tide of ſpiritual Joy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. When he refuſes or forbears to do this, there's a black Cloud upon all our Evidences, and we find nothing but Trouble and Sorrow. Many Holy Souls have been thus dealt with; <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter that ſhould releive them, hath been far from them,</hi> Lam. 1.16. And Faith hath with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſubſiſted in the midſt of perplexing Doubts and reſtleſs Fears.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What are thoſe Departures of God as to the Degree?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The exact Meaſure or Diſtance cannot be ſtated.</hi> We cannot ſay, that thus far God may go, and no further; for his Diſpenſations of this ſort are very different, with one and with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41523:71"/>another, yea with the ſame Believer at ſeveral Seaſons. Sometimes though he let us go out of his Hand, and do not actually uphold us, yet he is ſo near to us, as to be ready to catch us when we are falling; ſometimes he ſtands ſo far off, that he firſt lets us fall, and then raiſes us again. Sometimes he is within our reach, when we feel after him, ſometimes he is gone a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>length, and we cannot take hold of him. God ſets bounds to us which we cannot paſs, but we can preſcribe no Limits to him. The beſt are beholden to Soveraign Mercy, when they are at the worſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God does never totally depart from thoſe, whom he hath once vouchſaft his gracious Preſence to.</hi> His immutable Promiſe is the Believers Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt any ſuch Deſertion. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>He hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> The Truth of this Word would be not only ſhaken but overturn'd, if the forſakings of God were total at any Time. He never leaves us, but in Part; he never leaves us ſo, but that at the ſame Time he is ſtill preſent with us; if he leave us in one reſpect, he is preſent in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When he is with-drawn from us as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival, he is yet with us in a way of Support; when he does not Work in us <hi>to Do,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues working in us <hi>to Will.</hi> Though the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may retire as one that is griev'd, yet he is not abſolutely quencht; there is the Fire, when there is no Flame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>What are they, as to the Duration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is great variety in the dealings of God, as to this alſo.</hi> The Intervals of his Abſence from us are longer or ſhorter, as he ſees good. <hi>He changeth Times and Seaſons,</hi> not only in a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41523:72"/>Political (<hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21.) But in a ſpiritual Senſe, as it pleaſeth him. Our dead Calms have doubtful Periods; <hi>for his Wind bloweth when it liſteth.</hi> Sometimes Chriſt's renewed Viſits are more quick and ſpeedy, and ſometimes more ſlow and lingring, <hi>Song</hi> 3.4. <hi>It was but a little that I paſſed from them, and I found him whom my Soul loveth:</hi> She had juſt begun her Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after him, when ſhe met with him. So God ſometimes comes back at the firſt call; but Saints do not always fare ſo; at other Times <hi>when they cry and ſhout, he ſhutteth out their Prayer,</hi> Lam. 3.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Departures of God from true Believers are never final, they may be tedious, but they are Temporary.</hi> As the Evil Spirit is ſaid to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Chriſt for a ſeaſon,</hi> Luke 4.13. (Tho' he quitted that Temptation, he did not quit his Deſign, ſo as to Tempt no more) ſo the good Spirit withdraws from thoſe that are Chriſt's, for a Seaſon only, 'tis with a Purpoſe of come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again. When he hath moſt evidently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, 'tis as unqueſtionable, that ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he will return: And the Happineſs of his return will richly recompence for the ſadneſs of his Deſertion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.7. <hi>For a ſmall Moment have I forſaken thee, but with great Mercies will I gather thee.</hi> Here is not only a gathering af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a forſaking, but <hi>great Mercies</hi> to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for <hi>a ſmall Moment.</hi> He who hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to be our God for ever, cannot depart for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>What are the Cauſes and Occaſions of theſe ſad Departures?</hi> Among others theſe are the Chief.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:41523:72"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſeeking of our own Credit and Glory, or any other ſelfiſh Ends, in our ſerving of God.</hi> Where Pride is at the beginning of a Duty, ſhame will be (as one ſays) the Concluſion; God will make the Body of thoſe Actions to ſtink which are corrupted with an evil Eye; by the withholding of his Spirit, he will diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thoſe, who under a pretence of honoring him, do really aim to lift up and magnifie themſelves. When Men diſire to be extoll'd as <hi>Herod</hi> once was, <hi>This is the Voice of God and not of Man,</hi> he makes it appear that it is the Voice of a forſaken Man without any thing of God. A plain Sign of this evil is, <hi>when the Spirit that dwelleth in us Luſteth to Envy,</hi> when we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that our Reputations ſhould be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht, and our Names darken'd by another's ſhining Brighter. In that Caſe, we ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be troubled, that Gos is no better ſerv'd by us, but we ſhould rejoyce that he is better ſerv'd by others; it ſhould humble us that we are leſs uſeful than others, it ſhould not diſturb us that we are leſs eſteem'd; this is the way to drive the Spirit of God from us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Self-Confidence in the Performance of Religious Duties.</hi> The Spirit of God frequently and juſtly denies his Aid and Help in the carrying on of that Work, which we venture to Undertake without him. We ſhould <hi>never ſeek the Face of God,</hi> without <hi>ſeeking his Strength, Pſalm</hi> 105.4. Divine Power is communicated to us in a way of believing Expectation; <hi>Zech.</hi> 10.12. <hi>I will ſtrengthen them in the Lord, and they ſhall walk up and down in his Name.</hi> We are likely to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed beſt in Holy Services, when we go about them in a diſtruſt of our own Abilities, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41523:73"/>Sence of our own weakneſs. The greateſt Gifts and Graces will fail, by relying on them; and in thoſe very Things wherein Men moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in their own Apprehenſions, they uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall moſt ſhort. If we do not look up to God to prepare our Hearts, he will convince us how inſignificant our Perſonal Preparations are. If we Fancy that our own Enlargements will be ſufficient, 'tis no wonder, if we find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more ſtraiten'd and indiſpoſed then, than at any other Times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Self-Applauſe after the Performance of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Duties.</hi> When we Sacrifice to our own Net, the Spirit leaves us to Toyl in caſting it to no Purpoſe. The ſpiritual Man ſhall be caſt from his Excellency, if he aſcribe that to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf which belongs to God. When Grace hath been exercis'd in the higheſt Meaſure, the Heart ought to lye loweſt under the Conſideration of its own nothingneſs. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his <hi>labouring more abundantly than they all,</hi> he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects himſelf preſently, <hi>yet not I, but the Grace of God, which was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. He was afraid of that little boaſting Pronoun [I] and therefore retracts it, and ſtrikes Sail to the Grace of Chriſt, God will reſiſt, inſtead of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, if we ſteal his Crown, and put it on our own Heads. The Spirit will never agree to walk with us, if we take the uppermoſt Hand; and we ſhall loſe the Benefit of his Holy Breathings, if we be puffd up in our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits. God will diſable thoſe from doing any thing praiſe-worthy, that give not him the Praiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſetting up of Duties in the room of Chriſt.</hi> This we are exceeding apt to do; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41523:73"/>need to Learn that Leſſon of being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and becoming as little Children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. It was very truly ſaid by Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> that Deadneſs to good and gracious Works, and lively Activity in the Performance of them ſeldom meet together; high Degrees of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Holineſs, and a full devolving of the Soul upon Chriſt's imputed Righteouſneſs rarely Kiſs each other. 'Tis well, where they do, but 'tis a Provocation to God to abandon us, where they do not. If we would run in the way of God's Commandments, we muſt remember that <hi>it is not of him that runneth;</hi> if we would be aſſiſted in the Duties of Obedience, we muſt bear it upon our Hearts, that we can never be entitled to Heaven by them. We forfeit the Spirit of Faith, if we imagine that Faith it ſelf (the nobleſt of all Graces) does enrich us any otherwiſe, than as a Veſſel which holds the Treaſure; <hi>Sicut olla paecuniis referta hominem lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupletat.</hi> Calv.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Spiritual Sloth is another Cauſe; in the diſuſe of Gifts, not exerciſing of Grace, and neglect of Duty.</hi> This is the contrary extream to that Self-Confidence mention'd before, as that was a Conceit that we could do all Things in our own Strength, this is to ſit ſtill, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. We muſt ſtir up the Gift which is in us, if we would preſerve it; God uſes to help the Induſtrious, but he abhors the Sluggard. <hi>Seneca,</hi> a ſober <hi>Heathen,</hi> calls Idleneſs the Grave of a Living Man. Dr. <hi>Arrowſmith,</hi> an Holy Divine, ſtiles it the Hell of a Living Chriſtian. We hazard the taking away of our Talents, when we do not employ them. To let our Graces lye aſleep, is not the way to nouriſh,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41523:74"/>but to ſtarve them. Many have almoſt loſt the Spirit of Prayer, by the reſtraining of Prayer, <hi>Ariſe, and be doing, and the Lord will be with thee,</hi> 1 Chron. 22.16. If we leave God to do all, God will leave us to our ſelves; if we fold our Hands together, we cannot expect that his ſhould be ſtretcht out for our Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Sleightneſs and Formality.</hi> A ſincere Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, who is ſo in the Main, and Acts as ſuch for the moſt Part, may yet ſometimes imitate the Hypocrite too much, <hi>i.e.</hi> his Heart may be too little engag'd in approaching unto God. We too often pour out Words in Prayer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuitable Affections, too often attend on God's Word, without bending our Minds to it, or taking heed how we hear. Now by our reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much in the outward Forms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we loſe the Spirit of Power; by going in a Road of Duty, and performing this or that Act of Worſhip, becauſe we are accuſtomed to do it, we put our ſelves out of the Way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influences. When we do not ſerve God with <hi>our Spirits,</hi> we may well expect to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of <hi>his Spirit;</hi> when we do not ſeriouſly and earneſtly purſue Communion with God in Duties, how can we expect to enjoy any? We put off God with a little bodily Exerciſe, God puts off us with a viſible Church-Priviledge; we lift up our Hands in the Sanctuary, without our Souls, he lets us ſee nothing of his Power and Glory there.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Worldlineſs and Carnality.</hi> The minding of Earthly Things clips the Wings wherewith we ſhould mount up towards Heaven. So far as we are joyned to ſuch Idols, we may look to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from God; we open our Boſoms to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41523:74"/>them, and he hides his Face from us. Hence it is that that Condition of Life which does moſt pleaſe and gratifie the Fleſh, does moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the withdrawings of the Spirit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when our Portion of good Things in this Life, is very large, we are very prone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce inordinately in it; and when the World ſmiles much upon us, we commonly grow fond of the World. Therefore a low or afflicted State hath been oftner bleſs't with ſweet incomes from Heaven, than the height of Proſperity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>As the Sufferings of Chriſt abound in us; ſo our Conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt,</hi> ſome have enjoy'd ſo much of God in Priſons (as that Martyr in <hi>Bonner</hi>'s Coal-hole) that they have been unwilling to receive their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But 'tis very uſual, that according to what Men gain in Temporals, they loſe in Spirituals.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Baſe and ſinful Compliances for the avoiding of outward inconveniencie.</hi> This is as great an Offence to the Spirit of Chriſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> once was to Chriſt himſelf in a like Caſe. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording of a Man's Preſence at <hi>falſe</hi> Worſhip, may juſtly provoke God to deny his wonted Communications to us, when we are joyning in the <hi>true.</hi> If a Man partake of the Table of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> what Divine Fellowſhip can he look for at the Table of the <hi>Lord?</hi> The woful declinings of many Perſons, who have been meerly led by Fear to Build up what they formerly deſtroy'd, have been too plain a Teſtimony to this Truth. <hi>Sulpitius</hi> (the Hiſtorian) who liv'd with St. <hi>Martin,</hi> tells us that after he had joyn'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>Ithacius</hi> the perſecuting Biſhop, through the Threatenings of the Emperor <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus,</hi> there was a remarkable Suſpenſion of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41523:75"/>thoſe Influences and Graces for which he was eminent before. [Dr. <hi>B.</hi> Anſwer to Letter of the Aſs, <hi>Gen. p.</hi> 29.] The beſt Way to retain the Spirit, is to retain our Integrity, whatever we hazard by it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Dejection wilfully indulg'd.</hi> There is a ſaying of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors mentioned by <hi>Druſius, Spiritus Sanctus non reſidet ſuper hominem moeſtum;</hi> the Holy Spirit does not delight to dwell with one of a Sorrowful Spirit; and 'tis in great meaſure true. The Spirit of God is not a Spirit of heavineſs, 'tis no Pleaſure to him to ſee any of his Saints go mourning and bowed down, when their Hearts ſhould rather be lifted up in the ways of God. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was ſore afraid when the King took Notice of the ſadneſs of his Countenance, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.2. And <hi>Mordecai</hi> would not enter the Court-gates with his Sackcloath on, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4.2. An Holy Joyful Frame, and Garments of Praiſe are always come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Upright ones, and moſt acceptable unto God. As <hi>David</hi>'s Muſick drove away the Evil Spirit that troubled <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo Chriſtian Alacrity (not vain and fooliſh Levity) is a means of having the good Spirit to abide with us. Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening our ſelves in Sorrow is giving Way to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, the Sin of which he eſpecially reproves.</p>

               <p n="10">10. <hi>REjecting the Preſent Motions of the Spirit, which ought to be inſtantly embrac'd and followed.</hi> All the Spirits Motions are ſeaſonable, and therefore not to be put off; for Delay is a kind of denial, and ſavours of ſuch ungrateful Contempt, as muſt needs be very diſpleaſing to him. When thou ſaidſt, <hi>Seek ye my Face, my Heart ſaid unto thee, thy Face will I ſeek,</hi> Pſalm 27.8. God does not only expect ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but expects it immediately upon his Call. When ever he blows with his Wind, he looks that we ſhould ſpread our Sails. If we refuſe his offer'd help, we may deſervedly want it when deſir'd. As Chriſt withdrew himſelf from the Spouſe, becauſe ſhe let him ſtand knocking ſo long at the Door of her Heart, and ſhe ſtill deferr'd to open, and tir'd out his loving For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance with vain and frivolous Excuſes, <hi>Song</hi> 5.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as we muſt not omit the preſent
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41523:76"/>Performance of any Duty which he excites unto, we muſt not check his Influences by being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Duties which he aſſiſts us in: If we do not improve extraordinary Aids by holding out the longer, we provoke him to depart.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Dallying with Satan's Temptations.</hi> This was <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Caſe, he went on Mocking <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> three Times one after another, till at laſt he told her all his Heart. So <hi>Eve</hi>'s parleying with the Serpent, inſtead of giving a <hi>reſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,</hi> was the introduction to all that Sin and Miſery, which hath ſince fill'd the World. There can be no Converſation had with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Spirit,</hi> but that the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> will be offended by it. An intimate Friend would take it ill, and would have Reaſon to keep at a more than uſual diſtance from us, if he ſaw us maintaining any familiar Correſpondence with his avowed Enemy. If we grow bold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous in playing with the Devils baits, the Spirit of God will be more ſhy of having Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with us. If we do not vigorouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the firſt Suggeſtions and Aſſaults, we can have little Hope of being aſſiſted in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Temptation, and much leſs of come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off with Victory at the End of it. He that will tread upon the Edge of a known Snare, which he ſhould fly from, is generally left to be caught and taken in it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Careleſsneſs and Negligence in our daily Walk.</hi> This may be, and is too often the fault of thoſe, whoſe Hearts nevertheleſs in the main are upright with God. The Fear of God is in them, but 'tis not conſtantly before them, as it ought to be. Though they be not habitual, Cuſtomary Sinners, yet for want of taking that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41523:76"/>heed to their Ways which they ſhould do, they may fall into ſcandalous and hainous Sins; and what leſs can we ſuppoſe that this ſhould iſſue in, than a Departure of the Spirit of God from them? And therefore when <hi>David</hi> came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, after his foul Miſcarriage, and reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what he had done, he might well put up ſuch a Prayer, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.11. <hi>Caſt me not away from thy Preſence, take not thy Holy Spirit from me.</hi> This was what he dreaded and depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the juſt and natural Conſequent of his Sin. He that would not expoſe himſelf to ſuch a Judgment as this is, needs to be very watchful and Circumſpect; for if we do not <hi>ponder the Path of our Feet,</hi> and look well to our goings, we ſhall ſlip into the Mire, before we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>What are the Effects which follow upon theſe Departures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A manifeſt deadneſs both in Private Duties and Publick Ordinances.</hi> 'Tis ſaid of the ſlain Witneſſes, that when the Spirit of Life from God enter'd into them, <hi>They ſtood upon their Feet,</hi> Rev. 11.11. When the Spirit withdraws, we can by no means lift up our ſelves, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creep as it were, and grovel on the ground. 'Tis ſo</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In Private Duties;</hi> the Ebbings and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which we often find in the Exerciſe of Grace, the <hi>various and unequal Motions</hi> of our Souls towards God, when we are alone, in our Retirements, plainly prove that the Spirit of God is not always alike preſent, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he is more or leſs ſo, we are either lively or drooping. When the Spirit is in the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41523:77"/>Wheels, we are able to run, but if not, we tire. When we have him with us, we go on <hi>ſwiftly,</hi> when we are without him, we draw very <hi>heavily.</hi> When God pours out his Spirit upon us, how fervently can we pour out our Souls to him? When he is departed, how ſtrangely are we bound up? The Influence of the Spirit ſets us on Fire, and in his Abſence we can get no warmth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis the ſame in Publick Ordinances.</hi> When God fills them with his own Preſence, there is a mighty Power, a glorious Majeſty, a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beauty, a ſatisfying Sweetneſs in them; but when God withholds himſelf, they are empty of all this. When the Spirit of God moves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Waters of the Sanctuary, they are a Stream that <hi>make glad the City of God;</hi> but elſe, even the Children of <hi>Sion</hi> have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment by them. Hence it is that the very ſame Perſons are ſo differently affected with, and wrought upon by the ſame Adminiſtrations at ſeveral Seaſons; ſometimes it may be, we meet with that raviſhing Pleaſure and Joy in Worſhipping Aſſemblies, that we are ready to cry, <hi>it is good to be here,</hi> at other Times we feel no ſuch Thing. When we are in the Spirit on the Lord's-Day, <hi>the Sabbath is our Delight, the Word is ſavoury Meat, the Supper is a Feaſt of Fat Things;</hi> but without the Spirit, <hi>theſe Days of Heaven are loſt to us, and the Wells of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like dry Pits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A wretched indifferency towards the Service of God.</hi> As this is an Effect of God's departing, ſo it naturally follows upon the former; for where Men are not quicken'd in God's way, they will certainly need to be quicken'd to it.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41523:77"/>When the vigorous Reliſh of the Soul is gone, the Appetite will be gone proportionably. Our deſiring of the Word depends very much upon our <hi>Taſting</hi> of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 3. The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Meals we make in God's Houſe, the more we hunger; and the more we drink of the River of his Pleaſure, the greater is our Thirſt. Here lies our Miſery therefore, when through the Abſence of the Spirit God's Service is become undelightful to us, 'tis alſo too much undeſir'd by us. Some deſire to his Name is ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every gracious Soul, but 'tis marvelouſly cooled and abated, and the edge of it taken off; there is not that vehement Deſire, which the Scripture ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. There is not a <hi>deſiring with Deſire;</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> 22.15. There is not that <hi>Panting after God,</hi> nor that <hi>earneſt longing to come and appear before him,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> profeſſes, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42.1, 2. They can paſs over Seaſons of converſing with God, or be hinder'd of them, more eaſily than when the Spirit is preſent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Revival of ſecret Corruptions, whereby Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan gets great Advantages.</hi> The Evil preſent with us, is never ſo prevalent, as when the Lord is departed from us. Then thoſe Luſts which ſeem'd to be pretty well mortified and ſubdued before, ſtart up again, and recover their Strength, and the Devil falling in with them, does abundance of miſchief. Believers are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſometimes overcome by Temptations, which they Thought themſelves moſt ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and furtheſt off from a Compliance with; they are led to commit the very Sins which they had the greateſt Averſion to and Abhorrence of. Satan and indwelling Sin together do not make up
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41523:78"/>ſo great a Force, but that we may withſtand and repel them, when we have the Preſence of the Spirit of God; but when we are bereaved of that Preſence, we are too weak to grapple with them aſunder. Therefore the firſt Rule in the ſpiritual Warfare is, <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord,</hi> Eph. 6.10. 'Tis not to be believed, what an Head Corruption will get, and what inrodes the Devil will make, when a Saint is left but a little to himſelf. One Temptation is admitted after another, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faint and fruitleſs Reluctancy; like <hi>Jeruſalem That open'd her Feet to every one,</hi> &amp;c. Ezek. 16.25.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Impenitency for a Time under the guilt of Sin committed.</hi> There are ſeveral Cauſes of ſinful hardneſs, and among the reſt, we find it ſometimes in Scripture attributed to God; which cannot be underſtood, as if he were in any Senſe the Author of it, or the Agent in it, ſo as to produce it by poſitive Influence, but chiefly by Way of Privation, <hi>viz.</hi> by removing of the Spirit from us, whoſe proper work it is to ſoften, to make our Hearts tender, and bring us to Repentance. Hence it is that the very Children of God, ſuch as can boldly ſay, <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thou art our Father,</hi> do not only <hi>err from God's ways,</hi> but (which is more) are <hi>haſten'd from his Fear,</hi> Iſa. 63.16, 17. They may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commit Sin, but continue in it a great while, when the Caſe is ſo with them. 'Tis aſtoniſhing that <hi>David</hi> ſhould remain without Repentance ſo many Months as he did; we cannot imagine but that he often heard and read the ſixth and ſeventh Commandments in that Time, both in his own Houſe and in the Temple, and yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience lay aſleep ſtill, till the Spirit of God by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41523:78"/>
                  <hi>Nathan</hi> awaken'd him again. His <hi>Reproofs of Sin</hi> are the only <hi>Effectual Ones;</hi> for while he is ſilent, all other <hi>ſmitings</hi> will ſignifie little to ſound <hi>Conviction.</hi>
               </p>

A Man in a <hi>ſwooning fit,</hi> does not miſs the Things which are taken from him, juſt at that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they are taken, but afterwards he recollects what he had, and conſiders what is wanting. So 'tis here, at the very Time of <hi>God's Departure,</hi> we may ſtill <hi>Fancy</hi> that all Things continue as they were, but after he hath been ſome time <hi>departed,</hi> we ſhall diſcern a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious <hi>Change.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:41523:80"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They may not be throughly ſenſible of them for a much longer Time.</hi> When the Soul is in a <hi>drowſie Frame,</hi> though it begins <hi>to be allarmed,</hi> there is however ſome <hi>diſtance of Time,</hi> before it can <hi>ſhake off its ſlumbers,</hi> and perfectly open <hi>its Eyes. Spiritual Diſtempers</hi> creep upon <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers by Degrees.</hi> and ſo they go <hi>off</hi> again by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> alſo; they neither <hi>ſeize,</hi> nor <hi>leave us,</hi> all at once; but 'tis moſt unqueſtionably true, that they are ſooner <hi>Contracted</hi> than <hi>Cur'd,</hi> for the moſt Part. 'Tis an eaſier <hi>Matter to ſtupifie</hi> than it is <hi>to rouſe us.</hi> A Saint may firſt be convinc't by the <hi>Effects</hi> that <hi>God is departed,</hi> and yet ſome time may paſs, before he is duely humbled for the <hi>Cauſes of that Departure;</hi> he may ſee in ſome meaſure what his <hi>Condition</hi> is, a great while, ere he <hi>ſeriouſly Reflects,</hi> how he came into it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That which they are inſenſible of, is ſome Reaſon of their inſenſibility.</hi> When <hi>God departs,</hi> it is not to be ſuppos'd that our <hi>ſpiritual Senſes</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>vigorouſly Exercis'd</hi> as at other Times. We know, when our <hi>natural Spirits</hi> are <hi>obſtructed</hi> and <hi>retire, bodily Senſe</hi> is taken away by it; ſo in this Caſe, when the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath left us, there is more than <hi>ordinary dulneſs</hi> and <hi>benummedneſs</hi> which by that means ſeizes upon us. The Soul is therefore unapprehenſive of <hi>God's forſakings,</hi> becauſe <hi>God hath forſaken it;</hi> and 'tis a token for good, that he is about <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,</hi> when the Soul begins its <hi>enquiries</hi> after him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Devil is very buſie in contriving Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for us at ſuch Times, or in making us think that me are well enough, though we ſhould never be better than we are.</hi> Satan hath a great <hi>many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viees</hi> to keep us from attending to the <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations</hi> under which we are, or elſe to <hi>miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> our <hi>Condition</hi> to us.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Believers themſelves are oftentimes too much wanting in the careful Examination of their own State; and ſo there happen ſad Alterations, and they know them not.</hi> We are ready to truſt too much to <hi>former Trials,</hi> whereas we ſhould be <hi>frequently communing</hi> with our <hi>own Hearts,</hi> in order to a <hi>farther ſearch.</hi> It ought to be part of our <hi>daily Exerciſe,</hi> that we may ſee what ground we get or loſe. <hi>Reviews</hi> of our <hi>ſpiritual

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How great is their Miſery, whom God is at an Etcrnal diſtance from?</hi> The <hi>Spirit comes</hi> and <hi>ſtrives</hi> for a <hi>Time</hi> with many, upon whom he never <hi>reſts;</hi> and when he once <hi>goes away,</hi> he does not ſo much as <hi>ſtrive</hi> more.

               <p>THE Infinitely wiſe God knows very well how to ſerve his own Intereſts and Ends, both by acts of Judgment and Mercy. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> are ſuddenly <hi>struck dead</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter; and on the contrary, many ſick are healed in the following part of this Chapter; both are over-rul'd in an eminent manner for the propagation of the Goſpel in thoſe early New Teſtament times. This ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd the High-Prieſt and his Party among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they ſeiſe and impriſon the Apoſtles, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. but the very next Night an Angel is ſent to open the Priſon-Doors, and ſet them at Liberty, and commands them to go and Preach in the Temple, which they did accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Morning, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21. Their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being amaz'd at this Deliverance, and afraid of a Tumult among the People, bring them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41523:84"/>violence, before the Council, who charge them with Stubbornneſs and Sedition for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, after they had forbidden them, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. Hereupon <hi>Peter</hi> in the Name of the Reſt, makes a noble and couragious Defence. He tells them, that what they did, was to avoid the guilt of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, whoſe Authority is greater than Mans; <hi>ver,</hi> 29. <hi>And that the ſame Jeſus, whom they had Crucified, God had raiſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to be a Prince and Saviour, to give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Remiſſions of Sins,</hi> ver. 30, 31. This was the ſumm of what Chriſt himſelf had order'd to be Publiſht in his Name, and theſe were the Things which they were Commiſſioned to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie; <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47, 48. Therefore the adds in the Text, <hi>[And we are the Witneſſes of theſe Things,]</hi> The ſpreading of this Doctrine in the World, was a truſt which they had receiv'd, and they dared not to be ſilent; their Lord had expreſly ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall be Witneſſes unto me, both in Jeruſalem, and in all Judea,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.8. And no Prohibitions or Threatenings muſt ſtop their Mouths, or tempt them to neglect their Duty. But this is not all; that which follows in the laſt Clauſe of the Verſe, is yet more conſiderable: <hi>[And ſo is alſo the Holy Ghoſt whom God hath given to them that obey him,]</hi> q.d. Though you quarrel with us, and oppoſe our Teſtimony, there is a witneſs above all Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who may not only <hi>ſilence,</hi> but <hi>Cure</hi> your lnfidelity; we are not alone in this Work, we have one to back us, who is greater than all, even the Spirit of God himſelf. This agrees with what Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 15.26, 27. <hi>When the Comforter is come — he ſhall teſtifie
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41523:85"/>of me; and ye alſo ſhall bear witneſs</hi> —</p>
               <p>The Words are the Concluſion of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Reply to the <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrim,</hi> in which we have a brief Abridgement of his Sermon, or larger Diſcourſe, upon the Day of Pentecoſt, though that and this had very different Effects; <hi>they who heard that, were pricked to the Heart,</hi> and it iſſued in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Converſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.37. <hi>They who heard this, were cut to the Heart,</hi> and conſulted about ſlaving the Apoſtles, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. of this Chapter. The ſame Expreſſion is us'd concerning <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.54. And ſignifies the galling of their Conſciences; Which provoke them to a more furious Reſiſtance of the Truth, when they have been perſuaded to embrace it. Thus, that very Word (in ſubſtance the ſame) which is the ſavour of Life unto one, becomes the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Death unto another.</p>
               <p>Obſ. <hi>The Holy Spirit whom God hath given to them that obey him, is a Witneſs to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Text is not a direct Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctrine of the Trinity, but we have here all the Three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons brought in and mentioned together. Our Lord Chriſt is the Perſon witneſs'd to, the Holy Ghoſt is the Perſon witnesſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, and God the Father is the Perſon whom this Witneſs proceeds from, and is ſent by. <hi>Theſe are the Three that are ſiad to bear Record (or witneſs) in Heaven,</hi> 1 John 5.7. And indeed they all Teſtifie to each other. <hi>The Father bore Witneſs of Chriſt,</hi> John 5.37. Chriſt alſo was given <hi>to be a Witneſs to him, Iſa.</hi> 55.4. And in this Place, the Holy Ghoſt is named
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41523:85"/>as a Witneſs to Chriſt. In handling this,

               <p n="1">I. <hi>In what Senſe is the Holy Spirit given by God?</hi> In many Places, which 'tis needleſs to repeat, the ſame Phraſe occurs to us, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the New Teſtament. To prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding, in ſo fuudamental a Point, I ſhall endeavour (with an humble regard to the greatneſs of the Myſtery) to open it Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Poſitiverly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively. The giving of the Spirit by God the Father, does not import the Spirits being Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Father, nor does it exclude the Purchaſe and Gift of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This does not import the Spirit's being Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Father.</hi> How difficult ſoever it be to conceive the Order which is among the Perſons in the Godhead, we are ſure, 'tis impoſſible that there ſhould be any inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Bleſſed Spirit is one with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to him belong all the glorious Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Supream Being; he is the moſt High God, as the Father is. All the Three Perſons have the <hi>ſame Infinite Eſſence, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> the ſame Underſtanding, Will, and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Power. If any one Perſon be put beneath another, his Deity is thereby deſtroy'd; and therefore, we muſt take heed of any ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41523:86"/>Imagination concerning the Spirit of God. The Holy Ghoſt is given indeed, but not as by a Superiour, who hath a command over another, whether he will or not; for he is given with his own Conſent; and one equal may give another, if they agreee to do ſo; as in like manner Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Scripture calls <hi>God's Fellow,</hi> is alſo ſaid to be <hi>given of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This does not exclude either the Purchaſe, or the Gift of Chriſt.</hi> The Holy Spirit is given by the Father, and yet Purchaſed and given by the Son too.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Purchaſed by Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi> He hath obtained the Spirit for us, or elſe we ſhould never have partaken of him. Hence it is that he is ſaid to be <hi>ſhed on us through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour,</hi> Tit. 3.5, 6. His Bloud was the Price of this Priviledge, his Interceſſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures our actual Enjoyment of it. <hi>John</hi> 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comforther,</hi> &amp;c. After the finiſhing of his Work on Earth, and Exaltation to Glory, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That he receiv'd of the Father the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 2.33. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Holy Ghoſt, here is put for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt promiſed; to ſpeak ſtrictly, Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, in the Everlaſting Covenant of Redemption, upon ſuch and ſuch Conditions which he was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in the fulneſs of Time; but now, thoſe Conditions being perform'd, he receiv'd an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Accompliſhment of this Promiſe, not for himſelf, but for thoſe that belong to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Spirit is given by Chriſt.</hi> He is ſaid to ſhed him forth; in the laſt cited Place. So
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41523:86"/>he engag'd to ſend him, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.7. The ſame Act may very well be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both to the Father, and Son, as concurring in external Operations. <hi>My Father worketh hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and I work,</hi> Chap. 5.17. The Father is repreſented as the Maker of all Things, very frequently, and ſo is the Son; <hi>In the Beginning God Created the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> and in that beginning Jeſus Chriſt <hi>was with God</hi> not as an unactive Spectator, but as a Co-worker. Believers are ſanctified by God the Father, <hi>Jude</hi> 1. <hi>And they are alſo ſanctified in</hi> (or by) <hi>Chriſt Jeſsu,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2. The <hi>Greek</hi> Particle is the ſame in both Places; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Therefore 'tis manifeſt that the giving of the Holy Ghoſt by God the Father, is not at all inconſiſtent with the diſpenſing of the ſame Gife by our Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſitively.</hi> There are Four Things which ſeem to be ſignified to us, by the Father's giving of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Grace and Love of the Father, is the ſpring of all Divine Communications.</hi> Here is the firſt Riſe and Original of all the good that we receive; 'tis all reſolv'd into the Father's good Pleaſure, as the Primary moving Cauſe. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo laved the World that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis from the ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Eternal Love in the Boſom of God the Father, that this Gift of the Holy Ghoſt does iſſue alſo. 'Tis very remarkable therefore that our Lord directs the Faith of his Diſciples to faſten chiefly hereupon, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.26, 27. <hi>I ſay not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himſelf loveth you.</hi> The meaning is not that Chriſt would omit to mediate for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41523:87"/>them, or that his Mediation was not to be eyed by them, but the meaning is, that the Father's Love, does prevent as it were, this Act of Chriſt, and is the very ground which 'tis built upon; for Chriſt had never been appointed to this work, if God had not lov'd us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Communication of the Spirit is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether free and undeſerved.</hi> He is truly given; and whatſoever is proper Gift, is not beſtowed as a recompence to any previous Endeavours, but in a way of moſt gracious voluntary Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; it might be withheld, denied and kept back, without the leaſt ſhadow of unrighteouſneſs or wrong to the Creature. God is under no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to give the Spirit to any, but what by his own Promiſe he hath laid upon himſelf; and there is no Promiſe, but what <hi>Mercy</hi> is as much concern'd in the making, as <hi>Truth</hi> in the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of. God hath practiſed <hi>to give the Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> and for our our Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is deſcrib'd as more willing to give the Spirit upon our asking, than the tendereſt Parents are to give neceſſary Suſtenance to <hi>their own Children,</hi> Luke 11.13. But is this ever the leſs an Act of Grace, becauſe we are put to beg it? And is not our very begging an effect of Grace receiv'd? For we cannot ask the Spirit, without the Spirit; the Spirit of Supplication is poured out, where Pleaded for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That when the Spirit of God is once communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he is never totally recall'd,</hi> God does not take away what he gives, of this ſort. <hi>His ſaving Giſts</hi> (as the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is) <hi>are without Repentance,</hi> Rom. 11.29. In them is <hi>Continuance;</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5.) Their Duration runs Parallel with
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41523:87"/>the being of the Giver. They that are really made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, in his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſanctifying Operations cannot loſe him. He is given <hi>to abide with them for ever;</hi> they are his <hi>Living Temples,</hi> which ſhall be at no Time forſaken, or left deſolate. There may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient workings, and long ſtrivings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with carnal Hypocrites, but they are not indeed poſſeſt of him, and therefore are ſinally without him. There was a notable Difference between the Anointing of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> the former with a Vial, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.1. The latter with <hi>an Horn of Oil,</hi> Chap. 16.1. God's Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are very ſigniſicant; the Horn was a more ſolid, the Glaſs a more brittle Subſtance, to intimate the <hi>permanency</hi> of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with <hi>David,</hi> and its ſudden removal from <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That the Communication of the Spirit is an exceeding valuable Bleſſing.</hi> When God is ſaid to give the Holy Ghoſt, it implies the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe that receive him. 'Tis an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſingular Favour on God's Part, and a Matter of unſpeakable Advantage on their Part, both to themſelves and others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis the greateſt Advantage to themſelves.</hi> There are many good and perfect Gifts of God, but this Gift excells. The Promiſe of Chriſt in the Old Teſtament, and of the Spirit in the New, contain all the Promiſes in Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency. There are ſome Things which God gives in Anger, but he never gives the Spirit ſo. There are ſome Things which God diſtributes promiſcuouſly, and ſome times, to thoſe whom he hates, moſt plentifully; <hi>but the Spirit is a Gift which the World cannot receive,</hi> John 14.17.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41523:88"/>Other Things may be the lot of ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the <hi>Day of Deſtruction,</hi> but they that have the Spirit are ſealed to the <hi>Day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Tis a great Advantage to others alſo,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.7. <hi>The Manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every Man to profit withal.</hi> No Perſons in the World ſo uſeful in their Places, as they that partake of this bleſſed Gift. It was this which recommended <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Gen. 41.38. <hi>Pharaoh ſaid unto his Servants, can we find ſuch an one as this, a Man in whom the Spirit of God is?</hi> One fill'd with the Holy Ghoſt is worth a Thouſand of common Men; he is a capable Inſtrument of much more good in his Generation, than all the Philoſophers, Criticks, and Diſputers of his World with their vaſt ſtores of unſanctified Learning.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Whom is this Spirit given to?</hi> The Anſwer is in the Text, <hi>to them that obey him.</hi> For the clearing of this, there are Three Things, which ſhould be a little enquir'd into; Who is the Perſon here ſaid to be obey'd? What is meant by our obeying him? And how we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Spirits being given unto ſuch?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Who is the Perſon here ſaid to be obey'd? [To them that obey him,]</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 'Tis indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to all the Three Perſons; Father, Son, and Spirit, as they are all the juſt Objects of our Obedience, God the Father is to be obey'd in the Commands which he gives forth, God the Holy Ghoſt is to be obey'd in his inward Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon our own Hearts; but I incline rather to their Judgment who Interpret this eſpecially of God the Son, Jeſus Chriſt, This ſeems the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41523:88"/>faireſt Conſtruction, if we view the Words in the Original, we are his <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>i.e.</hi> Chriſt's Witneſſes. Chriſt is the Perſon ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of firſt and laſt; the Verſe begins and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with him, Now that Chriſt hath a right to our Obedience, is undeniable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe we were made by him; and as his Creatures, we are bound to be his Servants.</hi> He that brought us into <hi>Being,</hi> may upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count require the utmoſt Performance of <hi>Duty</hi> from us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As he is our Redeemer. he is entitled to be our Ruler.</hi> He may very well give Laws to us, that hath reſtor'd our Lives to us; as the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Man urg'd to the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they cenſur'd him for carrying his Bed on the Sabbath-day; <hi>John</hi> 5.11. <hi>He that made me whole, the ſame ſaid unto me, take up thy Bed and Walk,</hi> q.d. it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me to follow his Orders, to whom I owe my Recovery. Chriſt is <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> to the ſame Perſons; and all that are ranſom'd by him, are thereby engag'd to be ſubject to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What is meant by obeying him here?</hi> Some render it by Believing; and that this muſt be included (if it be not principally intended) I would offer theſe few Argumeuts to prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith it ſelf is the higheſt Act of Obedience.</hi> We read of the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> Rom. 16.26. As the great End of the Goſpels Publication; and the very ſame Words are render'd <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Faith,</hi> Chap. 1.5. If we ſhould take Faith here for the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the receiving of this Doctrine is ſet forth by Obedience, <hi>In believing we obey; for this is his Commandment, that we ſhould Believe,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. Indeed 'tis the moſt difficult
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41523:89"/>Duty, as they that are found in the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, are able to declare from their own Experience. Preſumption is eaſie, but the true Exerciſe of Faith is hard Work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith is the Foundation of all Evangelical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi> Obedience is that which inſeparably reſults from it, but can never be preſuppoſed to it. <hi>By Faith, Abraham, obeyed, when he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to go out of his own Countrey into a ſtrange Land,</hi> Heb. 11.8. And whoever obey from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Principle, they are nothing in God's Account, and all that they do, will avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them. <hi>Receiving</hi> of Chriſt is the firſt Act, and <hi>yielding</hi> our ſelves to him, is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>We are expreſly ſaid to receive the Promiſe of the Spirit through Faith,</hi> Gal. 3.14. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and Faith is oppos'd to Works, twice in this very Caſe <hi>of receiving the Spirit,</hi> ver. 2, 5. And therefore the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is the Doctrine of Faith, as diſtinguiſht from the <hi>Law,</hi> which is the Rule of Works, is ſtiled <hi>the Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8. A Road of doing, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from believing, is not the Way of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How are we to underſtand, the giving of the Spirit to them that obey Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It muſt not be underſtood, as if this were the Reaſon of the Gift, or the actual Qualification of the Perſons before the receiving of this Gift.</hi> Our foreſeen Faith and Obedience is not the Reaſon why God gives the Holy Ghoſt to us; for he is given freely (as hath been ſaid) from no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motive, but the meer Kindneſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of God to loſt and undone Sinners. Nor are any Perſons ſo qualified and prepar'd for the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41523:89"/>receiving of the Spirit, before he is given to them; for we are <hi>unbelieving and diſohedient,</hi> till the Spirit hath been mightily at Work in us. The whole Race of Manking, are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a wretched Company of Inſidels, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt Chriſt, without the Spirit. And there is not the leaſt Diſpoſition in us to any Duty whatſoever, but what is of his produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Believing and Obeying are the preſent Effects of the Spirit's Influence upon our Souls, aſſoon as he is given us.</hi> He is given in Order to this End, and this End is immediately and infallibly brought about by his <hi>powerful Agency.</hi> When the Holy Ghoſt was given to the <hi>Gentiles, their. Hearts were inſtantly purified by Faith,</hi> Acts 15.8, 9. To have the Spirit and remain one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment an Unbeliever, is a Contradiction. So we read of <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2. Where the Spirit is, he Acts as a Sanctifier; and where he Acts ſo, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly appears by the Fruit of Obedience; which flow naturally from it. So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe runs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within-you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In the Exerciſes of Faith and actings of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, we have more and more of the Spirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us.</hi> So we may underſtand the giving of the Spirit to them that obey Chriſt and believe in him, not of the <hi>firſt Donation,</hi> but of the <hi>increaſed Degrees and Meaſures</hi> of the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to thoſe that have him already. In this Senſe, we read of the Spirit's being <hi>given and receiv'd, John</hi> 7.39. He was given before Chriſt's Aſcenſion, but more ſparingly; when
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41523:90"/>he was aſcended, the Spirit came down in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Flouds; there was a more ſignal and liberal Effuſion. So, though the Spirit is poured out, that we may believe, yet after we believe, there are ſtill larger Portions continually given forth. This the Apoſtle calls the <hi>ſupply of the Spirit,</hi> Phil. 1.19. 'Tis the ſame Word which is uſed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Add to your Faith,</hi> &amp;c. God does not ſtop at the <hi>firſt</hi> Gift, but vouchſafes <hi>daily</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther additional Supplies.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>How is the Work and Office of a Witneſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the Spirit to our Lord Jeſus?</hi> Anſ. This may be ſhewn under four Heads diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. How he did it before Chriſt's coming, and during Chriſt's ſtay on Earth, and after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to Heaven? And how he does it even now at this preſent Time?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How did the Spirit perform the Work and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Witneſs to Chriſt before his Coming?</hi> Chiefly by Propheſie. Now here two Things are to be prov'd; that Propheſie was indeed a Witneſs to Chriſt, and that the Spirit did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Propheſie was a Witneſs to Chriſt.</hi> This the Scripture moſt poſitively Aſſerts, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets Witneſs,</hi> &amp;c. There are very numerous and plentiful Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which might be given of the Truth of this, if we look into the Prophetical Writings of the Old Teſtament, which unanimouſly Point to Chtiſt, as their main Subject. Our Lord calls the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſearch the Scriptures <hi>in General,</hi> upon this account, <hi>becauſe they teſtified of him,</hi> John 5.39. Various Predictions concerning Chriſt even in the <hi>Books of Moſes,</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41523:90"/>of David,</hi> in the <hi>Greater and Leſſer Prophets,</hi> in thoſe that Propheſied before the Captivity, and in them that Propheſied after the return out of Captivity. There were few or none among them all, but what foretold the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and gave ſome Character of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It was the Holy Spirit who witneſs'd hereby to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Spirit of God is ſaid to <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie in the Prophets, Neb.</hi> 9.30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. Whatever is written in the Word, he is ſtiled a Witneſs of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.15. Becauſe he dictated to the Pen-men of the Word, not only the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Subſtance,</hi> but the very <hi>Expreſſions</hi> themſelves. For <hi>Propheſie</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſays) <hi>came not in Old Time by the Will of Man, but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. When the Word was brought to them, it was not leſt to them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or chuſe out ſuch Terms as they thought beſt for the declaring and reporting of it; but they were acted herein by the Divine Spirit, (as Paſſive Inſtruments) to deliver all that which he ſuggeſted and nothing elſe. The Gift of Propheſie was entirely his, without and antecedent <hi>Preparations</hi> of their own; and the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of this Gift was from him, and under his Conduct and Management alſo. Therefore the Angel might juſtly ſay, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. <hi>The Teſtimony of Jeſus is the Spirit of Propheſie.</hi> This Teſtimony was born to Chriſt before his Coming, and the Spirit was the Author of it.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>HOW did the Spirit perform this Work of a Witneſs, when Christ was upon the Earth?</hi> I will mention only Three Ways,
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>His Viſible Deſcent upon Chriſt at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> Luke 3.22. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt deſcended in a bodily ſhape, like a Dove, upon him,</hi> &amp;c. It is not to my preſent Purpoſe to enquire of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Subſtance this Appearance was, the Form or Reſemblance here aſſum'd, is ſaid to be that of a <hi>Dove,</hi> which was obvious to Senſe, and ſeen by his forerunner, the Perſon that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd him, which was the Token that God had given him to know the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> by, <hi>and this he bare Record of,</hi> John 1.32, 33. That this was deſigned as a ſolemn Teſtimony to Jeſus Chriſt, is manifeſt, becauſe immediately after this he enter'd upon his <hi>publick Miniſtry;</hi> here was a Pledge firſt given of the Authority which he was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41523:91"/>inveſted with, that he might be accordingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd and regarded in the Exerciſe of his Office, which till now he had not begun.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>The extraordinary Works that were done by Chriſt, theſe were the Seals of his Commiſſion, and prov'd him to come from Heaven, for the Doctrine of an Impoſtor would never have been ſo ſignally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</hi> But now all theſe Works were done in the <hi>Power of the Holy Ghoſt, whom he is ſaid to be anointed with,</hi> and partly for that End, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. Particularly <hi>he caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God,</hi> Mat. 12.28. And for that Reaſon he charges the <hi>Jews</hi> with <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> againſt the Holy Ghoſt (the unpardonable Sin) who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd this mighty Act of his to <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the Prince of Devils, <hi>ver.</hi> 31, 32. If Chriſt himſelf only had been concern'd in this Work, this could have been <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> againſt him only, but ſeeing the Spirit of God concurr'd with him in it, they were guilty of <hi>Blaſpheming</hi> that Spirit alſo.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>The Reſurrection of Chriſt, which was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Teſtimony to his Eternal Deity, is aſcrib'd to the Spirit likewiſe.</hi> This Work is indeed in Scripture aſcrib'd to all the Three Perſons; <hi>to the Father,</hi> Rom. 6.4. To Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 10.17, 18. And the Holy Ghoſt is intereſted in it too. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up Jeſus from the Dead dwell in you, he that rais'd up Chriſt from the Dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal Bodies by his Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion</hi> of the Words, and the <hi>Relation</hi> which one Thing in them bears to another, ſhews this to be the meaning, that God will <hi>revive</hi> and <hi>raiſe</hi> the Dead Bodies of Believers by the ſame Spirit, by whom he rais'd his Son, that Spirit
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41523:92"/>who reunited the Humane Soul and Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, will reunite ours alſo. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. Quicken'd in the Spirit, the ſame Spirit by which he Preach'd to the Diſobedient in the Days of <hi>Noah,</hi> ver, 19, 20. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How did the Spirit witneſs to Chriſt after his Departure into Heaven?</hi> I mean in the Times of the Apoſtles, and in thoſe firſt Ages of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>Anſw. I. <hi>By the Revelation of the Myſteries of the Goſpel to the Apoſtles, which they were to Preach to others.</hi> This we have an Account of from Chriſt himſelf. <hi>John</hi> 16.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>I have yet many Things to ſay unto you, but you cannot bear-them now; howbeit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He ſhall Glorifie me, for he ſhall receive of mine and ſhew it unto you;</hi> which is repeated in the next Words. The Diſciples then were <hi>weak</hi> in the Faith, <hi>prepoſſeſt</hi> with carnal Notions about the Kingdom of Chriſt, and at that Time alſo <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm'd</hi> with Sorrow, upon the Notice of his intended Departure; and by this means they were uncapable at the preſent, of Learning all that they needed to be taught; now Jeſus Chriſt, who conſider'd their weakneſs, and dealt with them according to it, refers them to be more fully inſtructed by the promiſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; who though he did not diſcover any new Truths which they never heard, yet he brought old Truths to their Remembrance with <hi>new Illumination;</hi> he help'd their remaining Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Infrimity, in giving them a clearer Underſtanding of all the Things of Chiriſt, of all thoſe Doctrines concerning Chriſt, which were hid and veil'd from them before.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:41523:92"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By endowing them with a miraculous Power of doing thoſe Things, which were above the utmoſt activity of Nature, for the Confirmation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine.</hi> Thus he is ſaid, <hi>to give Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the Word of his Grace, in granting Signs and Wonders to be done by their Hands,</hi> Acts 14.3. <hi>God bearing them Witneſs with Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and divers Miracles, and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Heb. 2.4. A great many of thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Effects were produced by his means, in the Courſe of their Miniſtry, and ſome of them ſuch as even exceeded what were wrought by our Lord himſelf. So he had told them that it ſhould be, <hi>John</hi> 14.12. <hi>He that believeth on me, the Works which I do, ſhall he do alſo, and greater Works, than theſe ſhall he do, becauſe I go to my Faither.</hi> I would not go about to <hi>reſtrain</hi> this Text to the Apoſtles (becauſe Chriſt puts it in larger Terms, <hi>He that believeth,</hi> &amp;c.) but undoubtedly, it was <hi>verified</hi> in them. They were enabled to Work the ſame Miracles which he did, and in ſome Reſpects ſuch as out-did them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. The Healing of thoſe that were laid upon Beds and Couches in the Streets with the Shadow of <hi>Peter</hi> paſſing by, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. of this Chapter, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.11, 12. We read <hi>of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Miracles wrought by the Hands of Paul, ſo that from his Body were brought unto the Sick, Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs or Aprons, and the Diſeaſes departed from them,</hi> &amp;c. The Reaſon of theſe greater Works done by the Apoſtles, was Chriſt's going to the Father; which made Way for an eminent pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth of the Spirit, and this tended not ſo much to the <hi>Reputation</hi> of their particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (for they could not Work them when they would) as to the <hi>Glory</hi> of Chriſt, whoſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41523:93"/>Intereſt was hereby advanced in the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By the remarkable and numerous Converſions of great Multitudes to Chriſt, among whom they preach'd.</hi> As ſoon as ever the Holy Ghoſt was come upon them, there were Three Thouſand Souls added to them; <hi>That gladly receiv'd their Word and were Baptized,</hi> Chap. 2.41. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, theſe were made up Five Thouſand, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.4. All this was done in the compaſs of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few Days, and the firſt <hi>Harveſt</hi> was the <hi>Fruit</hi> of one Sermon. <hi>At Samaria, when Philip went and Preach'd Chriſt to them, 'tis ſaid that the People with one accord gave heed to the Things which he ſpake;</hi> Chap. 8.5, 6. Which is the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, becauſe they had all given heed to <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer before, <hi>from the leaſt to the greateſt,</hi> ver. 10. What a ſtrang and marvellous turn was here in an whole City, upon the Preaching of the Goſpel? In many other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Word of God grew mightily and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.20. It got ground againſt all the Oppoſition both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The Preachers of it were made to <hi>Triumph</hi> in Chriſt, and <hi>baffies</hi> all contrary attempts, from open <hi>Enemies,</hi> and falſe <hi>Brethren,</hi> and overcame the <hi>Devil</hi> by the Word of their Teſtimony. And the way of doing all this, is explain'd to <hi>us,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. <hi>My Speech, and my Preaching was in Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power.</hi> The Spirit of God accompanied their Word, and made it thus ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>By the ſupernatural Gifts which were beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon other Believers alſo, as well as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi> The Truth of this might be made out by ſeveral Inſtances, if it were needful. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. <hi>While Peter ſpake, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41523:93"/>them which heard the Word,</hi> viz. <hi>Cornelius, and his Kindred and Friends, whom he had call'd together,</hi> ver. 24. But how did he fall on them? <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf explains it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.15. <hi>As on us at the beginning;</hi> i.e. in a miraculous extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Manner. So Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17. <hi>Theſe Signs ſhall follow them that believe; in my Name ſhall they caſt out Devils, they ſhall ſpake with new Tongues,</hi> &amp;c. Not only they that Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht the Goſpel, but they that receiv'd it, were many of them thus eminently gifted by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; and this was much for the Honour of Chriſt, whom they believed in, and ſerv'd to reſcue his Goſpel from that Contempt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach which the World was ſo apt every where to pour upon it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>By the admirable Patience and Reſolution both of the Apoſtles and other Believers in the extream Sufferings which they underwent for Chriſt and the Goſpel. I think</hi> (ſays <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles, as it were appointed to Death,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.9. He proteſts for his own Part, <hi>that he Dyed daily,</hi> Chap. 15.31. <hi>Stood in jeopardy every Hour,</hi> ver. 30. Others, to whom he writes, <hi>endured great fights of Afflictions,</hi> Heb. 10.32. Not little <hi>Skirmiſhes,</hi> but continual <hi>Combats.</hi> What vaſt numbers of them crown'd all at laſt with Martyrdom, which is the moſt peculiar Notion of witneſſing? And with what <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>undauntedneſs</hi> was all this done, as by Men that had fully learnt to deſpiſe their own Lives, and deareſt Comforts, together with the greateſt Cruelties of their Adverſaries. But whence did all this proceed? From the Spirit of Glory reſting on them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. As <hi>Stephen being full of the Holy Ghoſt, ſaw the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41523:94"/>Glory of God,</hi> when his Murderers <hi>gnaſh their Teeth,</hi> Acts 7.54, 55. Their dying witneſs to Chriſt, was through the ſpecial Aſſiſtance of his Bleſſed Spirit</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>How does the Spirit witneſs to Chriſt, even now in our own Times?</hi> For there is a never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teſtimony which he gives ſtill, and will always give to the End of the World. Not by <hi>Voices, Dreams,</hi> or <hi>Enthuſiaſtick Inſpirations,</hi> which are uſually dangerous Deluſions, where they are pretended and reſted on, but in ſuch Ways as are ſafe and clear, and highly benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. As
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>The Spirit witneſſes at this very Day to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the written Goſpel.</hi> This is the ſtanding <hi>Memorial</hi> and <hi>Regiſter</hi> of all Divine Teſtimony. There the Doctrine of Chriſt is preſerved uncorrupt, and is the ſame in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to us, that it was originally to the firſt Chriſtians; and here we have a ſufficient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Miracles which recommended and backt this Doctrine. I ſay, a ſufficient Hiſtory, ſufficient to Anſwer the End, though not a compleat Hiſtory of all that was done. <hi>John</hi> 20.30, 31. <hi>Many other Signs did Jeſus in the Preſence of his Diſciples, which are not written in this Book, but theſe are Written that ye might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus is the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. They were not only wrought, but are written in Order to our Believing; this puts it out of doubt, that we are bound to Believe upon the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe Miracles, which we never ſaw, as faithfully related; if they were to be renewed in every Age, the commonneſs of them would make them loſe their End; and every Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after they are ceaſed, might challenge a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41523:94"/>of them, as well as one; and to what Purpoſe ſhould Perſons be enjoyn'd to tell the wonderful Works of God to their Poſterity, if they were not oblig'd to give Credit to them? As <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.2. And many other Places.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>He witneſſes to Chriſt by the Operations and Effects which the Goſpel hath upon all the choſen of God; for hereby it is diſtinguiſht from the Word of Man, even by its Effectual Workings,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2.13. There is no Compariſon between them in their Natures, <hi>For what is the Chaff to the Wheat?</hi> Jer. 23.28. Nor in their Operative Vertues; <hi>For is not my Word like as a Fire? ſaith the Lord, and like an Hammer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 29. This ſhews the Power of the Spirit attending it; this is that which puts an Edge upon the Word, and gives a force to it; which makes it quick and mighty, ſharp and ſearching in the Work of Conviction; hereby it takes hold of Sinners, <hi>Caſts down Imaginations, and brings every thought into Captivity to the Obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5. The Word alone would not do this; <hi>but as it comes in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.5. There are Impreſſions of the Majeſty and Authority of God upon the Word, ſtampt by the Spirit, but the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit muſt enable us to diſcern them; as a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger muſt Learn to know an Artificer's Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip from himſelf.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>By giving us an inward Experience and feeling of the Things of Chriſt.</hi> Spiritual Sences are a great Advantage to thoſe that have them, and whoever have them, are beholden to the Spirit for them. Hence it is, that the Things of Chriſt, are called the Things <hi>of the Spirit of God, which the natural man neither does receive,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41523:95"/>nor can know,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. A meer notional ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with them, is vain and inſignificant, and yet this is all that any Man in the World by Nature, without the help of the Spirit, can Riſe up to. We know them by receiving them; they are ſtrange Things, till they are taken in, and made Familiar to us, by real and experimental Knowledge. Therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in himſelf,</hi> 1 John 5.10. That Verbal Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which is without him in the Scripture, is then tranſcrib'd within him on his own Heart; he is ſatisfied from himſelf, which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and fulleſt Satisfaction.</item>
                     <item>4. <hi>By the producing of Faith in Chriſt, which is a Work that's never fulfilled in any Soul, where be is not given;</hi> for 'tis one of his Titles, <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. He infuſes the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, he excites to every Act. Divine Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faith requires a Divine and Supernatural Agent. 'Tis he that effectually Reproves for the Sin of unbelief, <hi>John</hi> 16.9. He diſcovers the Diſeaſe, he applies the Remedy. 'Tis a part of the Myſtery of Godlineſs, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is believed on in the World,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of it is, that he is <hi>juſtified in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. But one part Contributes to the unriddling of the other. If Chriſt were not juſtified in the Spirit, he would not be believ'd on in the World. Chriſt is juſtified in or by the Spirit, whenever any one in the World is perſuaded to believe; they are the Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Arguments on the behalf of Chriſt, that ſway the Soul to a receiving of, and cloſing with him. He reveals thoſe Things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt to us, which could not enter into
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41523:95"/>our Hearts to conceive of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10.</item>
                     <item>5. <hi>By the ſtrengthening and increaſing of this Faith daily, after he hath produc'd it.</hi> There are gradual Diſplaies of the Glory and Excellency of Chriſt to the believing Soul; all is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted at once; there are freſh Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of Light and Grace, as long as we are in the World, that our Faith may grow, and that what is lacking in it, may be perfected. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Spirit enriches us in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of our Sanctification, the <hi>Teſtimony of Chriſt is confirmed in us,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.6. He grounds and ſettles us, and makes us unmoveable from the Hope of the Goſpel; he fortifies and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes us againſt various contrary Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby the Devil is frequently endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to looſen our hold of Chriſt, and beat us off from him. We are poor wavering, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady Creatures when we are left to our ſelves; rejoycing one Moment, and drooping the next, confidently aſſured of that at one Time, which we are ready to call in Queſtion at another. The beſt Believers in the World will moſt humbly own this; the ſtrongeſt Faith would certainly fail, if the Cauſe of Chriſt in the Soul were not often pleaded over again by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as an Antidote for the Motions to Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</item>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt never will, nor can be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41523:96"/>a Witneſs, becauſe the Eternal Spirit is his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who will never with-dram his Teſtimony.</hi> This Spirit of Chriſt is given to all that obey him, and he teſtifies of Chriſt to them, and by them to others; but if we could ſuppoſe, this whole Generation of the righteous to be extinct (which yet ſhall never be; as long as the Earth remains) if all theſe Humane Witneſſes were ſlain, and not one left to ſtand up on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Chriſt in the World, yet while the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſurvives as a faithful Witneſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 'tis impoſſible that Chriſt ſhould be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. Let the Rage and Malice of the World against Chriſt go as far as it can, in ſtopping the Mouths or ſhedding the Blood of all that receive or bear the Record which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his Son, the Spirit cannot be prevented from doing conſtant Honour to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Word of Chriſt hath a better Foundation, than any Teſitimony from Man, or from any Church, or Party of Men whatever.</hi> As Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He had a greater Witnrſs than that of John,</hi> John 5-36. <hi>Concerning thy Teſtimonies, I have knowu of Old, ſays David, that thou haſt founded them for ever,</hi> Pſalm 119.152. But if mortal Witneſſes were their only Supporters, they would be as liable to fade and periſh, to be ſubverted and deſtroyed, as other Inferiour Things. To build the Credit of the Goſpel upon Humane Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is like putting the Ark of the Teſtimony into a wooden Cart, which will be apt to ſhake and reel, if not to tumble. <hi>The Church of God is the Pillar and Ground of the Truth,</hi> 1 Tim.3.15. To hold it forth indeed, not to hold it up; not ſuch a Pillar as Houſes ſtand upon, but as Writings hang upon for Publick Notice.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:41523:96"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The unrighteous Judgment of Satan and the World against Chriſt, is and will be perfectly rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Now is the Judgment of this World;</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 12.31. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.11. <hi>When the Sprit is come; he will Reprove</hi> (or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince) <hi>the World of Judgment, becauſe the Prince of this World is judged.</hi> I take theſe Two Texts to refer to one and the ſame Thing; for the Prince of this World, and the World it. ſelf paſs the ſame Judgment on Jeſus Chriſt, and the Judgment of both is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; the World and its Prince, make up as it were but one Perſon, the Head and the Body; and they exactly Agree and Joyn in the ſame Sentence, to condemn our Lord Jeſus. But here is a Witneſs that nuls this Sentence; and plainly proves the Iniquity and Falſhood of it; and indeed none of the Devil's Devices can ſtand, when God himſelf comes forth to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and oppoſe them.</p>
               <p n="4">4.<hi>It muſt needs be a lying Spirit that ſpeaks a Word againſt Chriſt, or that derogates any Thing from him.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. <hi>I give you to nderſtand, that no Man ſpeaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jeſus accurſed.</hi> Whatever is ſpoken by any to the diſhonour of our Lord Jeſus cannot proceed from the Spirit of God. This is moſt certain, becauſe the Spirit of God cannot contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he cannot teſtifie for him, and againſt him too. The Holy Ghoſt is Chriſt's Witneſs, the unclean Spirit is his Adverſary; and too many Tongues are duided by this unclean and wicked Spirit, that pretend to Propheſie in Chriſt's Name; and whereas <hi>a true Witneſs delivereth Souls,</hi> Prov. 14.25. Theſe do lay ſnares for their Ruine and Deſtruction.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:41523:97"/>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>They that have the Spirit of God cannot err in what is eſſential to the Faith of Chriſt, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation.</hi> They are undoubtedly taught to hold the Subſtance of Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, though they may be miſtaken in leſſer Particulars. This is hinted by what our Lord ſays, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>There ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſt's and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great Signs and Wonders, inſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive the very Elect.</hi> That Parentheſis is the moſt material Part of the Propoſition; there is no poſſibility of any of God's choſen and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ones miſcarrying by a fundamental Deluſion; they have a Reſident Witneſs for Chriſt in their own Boſoms, who ſecures them from it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief is a ſpecial Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; all unbelief is ſo, though all unbelief</hi> (and perhaps no meer unbelief) <hi>is not the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. It is the Spirit that beareth Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe the Spirit is Truth,</hi> 1 John 5.6. <hi>But he that believeth not, makes him a Lyar;</hi> ver. 10. Hypocriſie is a lying to the Lord (as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira lyed to the Holy Ghoſt</hi>) but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity is a belying of him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.12. 'Tis a painting of the Spirit of God like the Sons of Men, who are Lyars upon Record, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. Yea, like the Devil, who is the <hi>Father of Lyes, John</hi> 8.44. This black aggravated Evil is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the not receiving of the Spirit's wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There are ſome Things, which we may hence be exhorted to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Set your Seal to the Truth of the Spirits Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony unto Chriſt, by Believing in him; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it not againſt your ſelves.</hi> Embrace him with all your Hearts upon the high and honourable
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41523:97"/>Commendation which the Holy Ghoſt gives of him. How readily do we repoſe a Confidence in Creatures, when we have receiv'd a worthy Character of them from Perſons of known In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity! And ſhall we be influenc'd more by the Witneſs of Man, than by the Witneſs of God? God forbid. How much greater Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements have we to Divine, than humane Faith? There are infallible Grounds for Divine Faith to reſt upon, which for humane cannot be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Grieve not the Spirit of God by Sin, that he may not deliver you up, nor leave you alone to be led away by Error.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt is often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd by Men's looſe Converſations to give them over to ſome unſound Opinions. Practical Godlineſs is an excellent Means for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Doctrinal Orthodoxy. <hi>If any Man will do his Will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine,</hi> John 7.17. Follow the Spirits Guidance in the Courſe of your Lives, if you would not forfeit it, as to the regulating of your Judgments. Be govern'd by him as a Spirit of Holineſs, if you would be inſtructed by him as a Spirit of Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whatever the Spirit in and according to the Scripture teſtifies againſt, give it no Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> That cannot be the Doctrine of Chriſt, which he doth not atteſt. 'Tis another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and therefore not to be receiv'd, though an Angel from Heaven were the Publiſher of it. <hi>We have a ſure Word of Propheſie, whereunto we do well to take heed,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. That muſt be no Article of our Faith, which we have not firſt tried, or which upon the Trial, is not approv'd by this Rule of Faith. According as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41523:98"/>the Teſtimony of the Spirit in the Word is, we are to Judge of every Cauſe which comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Regard the Witneſs of the Spirit, with reſpect to Chriſt in you, as well as Chriſt without you.</hi> He is a capable Witneſs as to both, for he ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Things; he knows the State and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of our Souls towards God, as well as the out-goings of the Heart of God to us. He that can reveal Chriſt in us, is undoubtedly the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to diſcover us to our ſelves. Therefore, <hi>what our Conſcience bears us Witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1.) Is to be comfortably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced in, as a faithful unerring Report. If Conſcience it, ſelf be as a thouſand Witneſſes, how much more when the Holy Ghoſt concurs with it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Beg the help of the Spirit in Order to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of your Teſtimony to Chriſt, as you ought to do, in your ſeveral Places,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. <hi>No Man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>What think you then of thoſe that call Chriſt Lord, Lord, and do not the Things which he ſays?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>'Tis true, the meer repeating of ſuch words is eaſie, and may be done without the Spirit;</hi> but if we ſay it from a right Principle, in a right Manner, and to a right End, it muſt be by the Holy Ghoſt. And therefore this ſaying, is like that confeſſing, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.15. Not a bare Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Confeſſion with the Mouth, but joyn'd with believing in the Heart.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Manifeſt your having of the Spirit, by your ready, reſolute and eonstant witneſs-bearing on the behalf of Christ. Be not aſham'd of the Testimouy
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41523:98"/>of our Lord,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.8. 'Tis the greateſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to us, when we are call'd to any ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to our great Redeemer. A Work which is done by the Spirit of God himſelf, muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably be a Matter of Glory and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch as we. Nor is it only upon ſolemn extraordinary ſpecial Occaſions, but in the whole Courſe of our Lives, in all that we think, ſpeak and do, we ſhould teſtifie to our Lord Jeſus. In ſhort, you who have the Spirit of Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in you, can do no leſs among a World of Men, that ungratefully deſpiſe him, than by your whole behaviour proclaim your deſerved eſteem of him.</p>

               <p>To underſtand the occaſion of the Words, we muſt look back as far us <hi>ver.</hi> 17. of this Chapter, where we find a young Ruler (as two of the other Evangeliſts deſcribe him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.18.) addreſſing himſelf with ſome Earneſtneſs and Reverence to Chriſt, for his Judgment and Advice in a very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Caſe; <hi>What ſhall I do, that I may inherit Eternal life?</hi> Chriſt framing his Anſwer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles then generally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd, of living by doing, refers him to the commandments: He that put the Queſtion ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving too good an Opinion of himſelf, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41523:99"/>affirms his keeping of them all; Chriſt in his Reply, to convince him that he was not ſo perfect as he pretended himſelf to be, offers him a Teſt which he could not comply with; <hi>viz.</hi> Selling what he had, and giving to the Poor, and taking up the Croſs, and following him. This was no unreaſonable Proof of his Obedience; for a reſolved Preference of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all that this World affords, and actual parting with all for it, when we are called thereunto, is every one's neceſſary Duty. But this Ruler was ſad at that ſaying, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way grieved; Carnal Men may be ſorry that they cannot bring down God to their own Terms, when they refuſe to come up to his; they would reconcile Things in Heaven, and Things in Earth, and enjoy their Portion in both Worlds. Hereupon our Lord applies the reſt of his Diſcourſe to his Diſciples, as being moſt concer'd for their Satisfaction and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; to them therefore he ſays, <hi>How hardly ſhall they that have Riches, enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi> ver. 23. Theſe Words aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht the Diſciples, and yet Chriſt with little Variation repeats them, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. And enforces them by a Proverbial Compariſon, which was yet more ſtartling, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>It is eaſier for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel to go through the Eye of a Needle, than for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Whether that which we render here a Camel, ſhould be rather Tranſlated a Cable-rope, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Original Word ſigifies both) is not much material; but certainly a Man with great Poſſeſſions, loaded with thick Clay, might be fitly enough repreſented by a camel, carrying Burdens more for others than himſelf, and the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41523:100"/>Entrance into Life being ſtrait and narrow, may very well be ſaid to reſemble the Paſſage through the Eye of a Needle. But this brings us to the Text it ſelf, wherein we have two Parts; the Amazement of the Diſciples at Chriſt's Doctrine and his own Explication of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Amazemenet of the Diſciples at this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt,</hi> ver. 26. <hi>And they were aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of meaſure, ſaying among themſelves, who then can be ſaved?</hi> The Word here, which we render by <hi>Aſtoniſhment,</hi> is not the ſame with that <hi>ver.</hi> 24. But more ſignificant, as if the Mind were not only ſtruck, but ſtruck out as it were, with Horror and Confuſion. Beſides 'tis added here, <hi>out of meaſure,</hi> or abundantly and exceedingly; for this Doctrine appear'd very rigorous and ſevere to them, as if it ſhut out all Perſons almoſt from a poſſibility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Becaufe
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Though all Men are not Rich, nor perhaps the moſt, yet there are few, but what deſire to be ſo, and the Love of Riches</hi> (which is indeed the Diſeaſe) <hi>prevails, where there is not the Poſſeſſion.</hi> It was very common among the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Prophet's Time; <hi>From the leaſt to the greateſt every one is given to Covetouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 6.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.10. And 'tis not leſs natural to other People.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>The Rich ſeem to have the greateſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Helps for Heaven, beyond thoſe that are of an Inferiour Rank;</hi> and therefore if their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be ſo difficult, they concluded that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might Deſpair of it.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>The Poor have their Temptations alſo, and fall into divers Sins, as well as the Rich;</hi> and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41523:100"/>there are other Things, which muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to be Impediments and Obſtructions in the way to Heaven, as well as Riches; ſo that they thought, if one ſtumbling-block was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and pernicious, the reſt might be as bad, and then all Mankind muſt be in a miſerable Cafe.</item>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt's own Explicatiln of this Doctrine; ver.</hi> 27. <hi>Jeſus looking upon them, faith, with Men it is impoſſible, but not with God; for with God all things are poſſible.</hi> Here are Three Things to be conſidered,
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>The general Ground which Chriſt ſpeaks upon; That all Things are poſſible with God.</hi> This is a Notion which ſhines clear by natural Light, the Being of God is not more demonſtrable than this, that Infinite and Unlimited Power belongs to him. This is plentifully confirm'd in Scripture, <hi>Job</hi> 42.2. <hi>I know that thou canſt do every Thing.</hi> Jer. 32.17. <hi>There is nothing too hard for Thee.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 1.37. <hi>With God nothing ſhall be impoſſible.</hi> If there were any Thing which God could not do, which is fit to be done, and becoming or conſiſtent with his other Perfections, he could not be God.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>The Particular Truth which he laies down, and builds upon this Foundation. With Men it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,</hi> that either the Rich or any other Perſon ſhould be ſav'd, but not with God, We muſt mot meaſure God's Power by our own; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>this is marvellous in our Eyes;</hi> we are not to think that 'tis ſo in his, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.6. Though Man cannot withdraw his own Heart from an inordinate Deſire and Purſuit of ſuch Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Enjoyments, yet God can enable as to do it, Though we cannot recover our ſelves out
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41523:101"/>of this Snare of the Devil, the <hi>ſtrong God</hi> can perform it for us; He can give us other Hearts than what we have by Nature, and produce ſuch a change in us, as we know not how to ſuppoſe; where Corruption makes the greateſt Oppoſition, he can Conquer it; ſo that a Poor Man ſhall be <hi>Rich in Faith,</hi> and a Rich Man <hi>Poor in Spirit.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>The Poſture and Aſpect of Chriſt in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Truth. He looked upon them</hi> (i. e. the Diſciples) <hi>and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. There ſeems to be a double Reaſon for this.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt hereby diſcovers his Knowledge of their Thoughts, and the most ſecret Paſſages of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation:</hi> For what they ſaid in the foregoing Verſe, they did not ſpeak ſo as that he might hear it, but <hi>among themſelves;</hi> or (as the words import) <hi>one to another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ hereby points out them, as ſingular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Examples of the Truth which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed:</hi> For as there were Holy Men under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> who were nevertheleſs rich in this World, ſuch as <hi>Abraham, Lot, Job, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> a rich Publican, was converted to Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.2. So theſe Diſciples, upon Chriſt's call, had left all and follow'd him, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. following the Text; and their <hi>All</hi> was as much to them, as the rich Man's larger Eſtate can be to him. So that in them was this ſaying of our Lord fulfilled.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>There is the Difficulty of Believing.</hi> This is <hi>primarily neceſſary</hi> to Salvation, and yet one of the <hi>hardest</hi> Things in the World to be done aright. The Counterfeits of Faith are frequent and feiſable enough, but they that imagine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Faith to be an eaſie matter, know not what it is. 'Tis commonly ſaid, That we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily believe, what we wiſh to be true; but this is a very great miſtake; we have ſeveral Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Scripture to the contrary. When <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons, at their ſecond return out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> told their Father that <hi>Joſeph was yet alive, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Land,</hi> his Heart <hi>fainted,</hi> for he <hi>believed</hi> them not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.26. When Chriſt ſhew'd his Diſciples his Hands and his Feet, <hi>they believed not for joy, Luke</hi> 24.41. We are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſlow in believing, what we are moſt eager in deſiring. So we may ſometimes believe that which appears to be more incredible, or is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more difficultly credible, and yet ſtill doubt of eaſier and leſſer things; as <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Siſters believed that their Brother would riſe again at the <hi>last Day,</hi> and yet queſtion'd his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed <hi>after four Days, John</hi> 11.24. with 39. Now if Men ſtick and heſitate at the leaſt things, it ſhews the Work to be much more difficult, than if they ſtumbled at the greateſt. But more particularly the Work of Faith is difficult at <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> living by Faith, and at <hi>last</hi> dying by Faith.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:41523:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The work of Faith, at the beginning of the Chriſtian Life; our first believing is difficult, when we come out of a ſtate of Sin, into a ſtate of Grace.</hi> A Soul that is deeply convinced of its own Guilt, ſtruggles with great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements in laying hold of Divine Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He that effectually declares this unto Man, needs to be an Interpreter, one of a thouſand, that is (ſays Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>) <hi>Chriſt himſelf; Job</hi> 33.23. Whatever vain Men may talk of being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by reaſon, that God is reconcilable; the Sinners own Conſcience, when truly awaken'd by the Commandment coming home, argues with a great deal of ſtrength againſt it. He that is purſued by a ſenſe of Sin and fear of Wrath, is far more apt to run into downright Deſpair, than to fly for Refuge to the Hope which is ſet before him. The threatnings of deſerved Vengeance are much rather regarded than the free Promiſes of Remiſſion. As God ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> with reſpect to their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings into Idolary, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7. <hi>How ſhall I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee for this?</hi> So the poor convinced Sinner, that hath his high and hainous Provocations ſet in order before him, is ready to cry, <hi>How ſhall God pardon me for theſe?</hi> Tis a Myſtery which he knows not how to apprehend; a comfortable Doctrine, but he cannot embrace it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Living by Faith; for this the just must do; after the Sinner is made Righteous by the Obedience of Christ, he must ſtill go on from Faith to Faith, as the Righteouſneſs of God is revealed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> Rom. 1.17. Now this is no light matter; whatever the Speculation be in their eſteem, who never arrived to any real Exerprience, the Practice is not. To live by Faith in the midſt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41523:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>of various Temptations and Tryals, of Darkneſs and Deſertion, of croſs Providences, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Rebukes, is an hard ſaying to Fleſh and Blood. Is it indeed an eaſie thing to believe, that we ſhall be preſerved blameleſs, and kept to Salvation, and never pluck'd out of the Hand of Chriſt, when we find our ſelves many times looſe and wavering, and incident to numberleſs Miſcarriages? Is it very eaſie to believe, that our Juſtification is perfect, when our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo defective? That we are compleat in Chriſt, when we are ſo, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſo meanly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd in our ſelves, that upon a review we might ſay with <hi>Paul, In us there dwells no good thing?</hi> Is it eaſie to look upon God as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and wait for him, when he hides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Is it eaſie to ſtick cloſe to him, when he ſeemingly forſakes us; and to believe his Love, when we feel his Anger; and to truſt his naked Word, when we ſee no appearances or likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods of Performances, but the contrary? They are inſenſible in Spiritual Affairs, that will not acknowledge a Difficulty in theſe things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Dying in Faith.</hi> This laſt Act of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is as requiſite as all the reſt: 'Tis ſaid of the Antient Patriarchs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. That <hi>they all died in Faith:</hi> For to caſt away our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then, is to caſt away our Souls. And yet to maintain and keep up lively hopes in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies of Death, to depart, like old <hi>Simeon,</hi> in the joyful ſight of God's Salvation, to cleave firmly to Chriſt, when Fleſh and Heart fail, to cloſe our own Eyes, and commit our ſelves bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Divine Guidance through the Valley of the Shadow of Death; when we are ſtepping out of the World, is certainly hard work to ſuch as we
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41523:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>are. That Faith muſt not be weak nor little, which makes a Man content to be ſtrip'd of the Body, as <hi>Aaron</hi> of his Garments on the Mount, <hi>Num.</hi> 20.28. to quit ſuch a well-built commodious Tabernacle, and lie down in the Duſt. This ſeems unnatural, after we have dwelt in this Houſe ſo many Years, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſcarcely to be perform'd without ſome more than ordinary violence. The love of Life will probably hold out as long as Life it ſelf; and the fear of Death in ſome meaſure, till we have taſted Death; and a World that we never ſaw cannot be very alluring, except the Eye of Faith be very clear and ſtrong. If believing, under ſuch Diſadvantages, when we come to die, be not difficult, nothing is ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is the difficulty of getting the Victory over Sin.</hi> Such a Victory muſt be gotten by every one that is ſaved; for where Sin is in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, there can be no Reigning in Life thro' Chriſt. 'Tis plain, That <hi>the Motions of Sins do work in our Members, to bring forth Fruit unto Death, Rom.</hi> 7.5. Theſe Motions therefore, tho' they cannot be prevented, muſt be repelled: Now an Enemy that is got within us, hath mighty Advantage againſt us, and it requires a great deal of ſtrength to be delivered from him; we cannot diſpoſſeſs him, and yet we muſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him; we cannot drive him out, and yet we muſt keep him under: Sin will have a being in us, and be giving continual diſturbance to us, and yet it muſt be ſo far deſtroyed, as not to have command over us. This is a very difficult At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement, and every one engaged in the holy Warfare ſinds it ſo; but particularly,</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:41523:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The entire abandoning of cuſtomary Sins, is hard work.</hi> Sins that have been made familiar to us by long practice, and frequent repetition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that perhaps we fall into them, before we are aware, and ſcarcely know when we have committed them, are difficult to be forſaken. The Holy Ghoſt expreſſes this by a direct im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility; <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots? then may ye do good, that are,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> one is as caſie as the other. The cure of inveterate Diſtempers, that have rooted themſelves in our Bodies, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed along time together, is no ſlight buſineſs; Remedies of ſmall force will avail nothing in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The abſolute renouncing of Conſtitution Sins, is ſtill harder.</hi> That there are ſome ſins peculiarly ſuited to our ſeveral Tempers, is undeniable, and to reliquiſh theſe is a work of ſpecial diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. A Man cannot gueſs at the ſubduing of his own Iniquity, by his maſtery of ſome other leſs pleaſing Luſts. 'Tis eaſier to conquer all the reſt, than this one: A Man that's almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to give up all, ſtops when it comes to his darling Sin: This Image of Jealouſie muſt be ſpared, though his other Idols be thrown down and broken in pieces. This above all is <hi>the ſin that eaſily beſets us, Hebr.</hi> 12.1. and the ſin which is hardly to be reſiſted, and vanquiſh'd by us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The weaning of the Heart from the Love of every ſin.</hi> We are not true Conquerors, till this be done: So long as any ſin hath any room or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in our Affections, 'tis really predominant, and we are properly its Servants, though we may be reſtrain'd from outwardly and openly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41523:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>it. Now this is a caſe that too often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens; ſin retires out of the viſible Converſation into its ſtrong Hold, the Boſom of the Sinner, and there it remains invincible: Many times there are are few of its Acts to be diſcovered in the Life, and yet there are ſecret ſtrong deſires and inclinations to it in the Soul. <hi>Balaam</hi> did not curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but his mind was ſet that way to the very laſt, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.10. 'Tis a thouſand times harder to hate one ſin, than to leave many.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is difficulty of ſtanding againſt the wiles of the Devil, Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. The ſtrength of this Adverſary is not contemptible, but his cunning is more formidable; we need to be very vigilant againſt him as a roaring Lion, but much more as he is a winding Serpent; we are in greater danger of his ſtealing us to Hell by Subtilty, than of his haling us thither by meer armed Fury. We that are ſo prone to be carried about by the Craftineſs of Men, who lie in wait to deceive, have much greater cauſe to be afraid of the Arts and Impoſtures of Satan; but particularly in many things 'tis difficult to diſcern him, and when we do, to avoid him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis difficult many times to diſcern the wiles of the Devil;</hi> as 'tis ſaid of the ways of the ſtrange Woman, <hi>they are moveable, that thou canſt not know them, Prov.</hi> 5.6. So may we ſay of the Paths of the Deſtroyer, they are intricate and diſguiſed, that we cannot find them out: He does not dig many open Pits, but Graves which appear not, which while we think to walk over, we fall into. The Holy Ghoſt ſays indeed, <hi>We are not ignorant of Satan's devices,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. but I conceive, that muſt be comparatively un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41523:104"/>the Saints of God are much more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them than other Men, though they know them leſs, in reſpect of concernment in them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24. they know them better, ſo as to beware of them. We are not univerſally ignorant, though we know but in part, neither our Knowledge nor Ignorance is total; ſome of his Devices are known to us, though many are hid from us. He too often deceieves us by his imitating of God, covering himſelf with light, as with a Garment; and when he is ſo covered, our Eyes are ſo dazled, that 'tis hard to ſee him as he is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis difficult many times to avoid him, even when we do diſcern him; becauſe our Duty generally lies betwixt Extreams on both hands, and when we run from one Extream, he drives us into another; and in the hurry of Temptation to keep the middle point is very hard.</hi> The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were firſt too remiſs in dealing with their inceſtuous Member, and afterwards too ſevere. When we find Satan getting an Advantage againſt us one way, to ſecure our ſelves from him, we run too far the other way, and this anſwers his end as well, and is therefore ſlily promoted by him. Either Sin is ſo ſmall that it needs no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, or elſe 'tis greater than can be forgiven; if Mercy be not preſum'd upon, then it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd of. So in the caſe of Divine Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Devil tempts us either to deſpiſe them, and harden our ſelves againſt them, or elſe throw up all, and utterly faint under them, whereas our Duty lies between both, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.5. So in the caſe of natural Affections to natural Relations, where we have not only allowance, but a command, 'tis hard ſo to govern our ſelves,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41523:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>but that Satan will make us either exceed, or fall ſhort, either let out our Hearts too much or too little; either not love them enough, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love them; either be guilty of Neglect, or of Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There is a difficulty in the performing of thoſe Duties, which ſeem to be contrary to each other.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the contrariety is but ſeeming, for all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are harmonious, and very well reconcilable, as all Scripture is, one part of it to another, notwithſtanding the appearance of oppoſition in ſome places; but however in matters of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, 'tis really hard ſometimes to know how to obey one Precept, without tranſgreſſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis hard to mourn, as we ought, for ſin, and yet to rejoice at the ſame time in Chriſt:</hi> For we are to do both, and this godly Sorrow is never to ſhut out ſpiritual Joy; <hi>For we are to rejoice in the Lord alway, Phil.</hi> 4.4. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.16. Our Tears ſhould never drown our Triumphs, nor our Lamentations ſilence our Songs; but as God ſometimes cauſes his Rain to fall, even while he cauſes his Sun to ſhine, ſo even when we are bewailing the breathes of the Command, we ſhould take in the Comforts of the Promiſe. Our Souls ſhould be afflicted, and yet revived; Sin ſhould be ever before us, and a Saviour too.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis hard to be duly thankful for the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Grace, and yet not to be contented with the higheſt meaſures of it.</hi> There is a neceſſity upon us, as to both; a little Faith requires high Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God, and yet the greateſt that ever Man had, is not to ſatisfie us. We are to <hi>forget thoſe things which are behind, Phil.</hi> 3.13. and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41523:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>remember to bleſs God for the leaſt of them. We muſt look beyond them in order to further attainments, and yet never ungratefully or contemptuouſly overlook them. We muſt neither ſay of our day of ſmall things, <hi>This is nothing;</hi> nor yet muſt we ſay, <hi>It is enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>There is a difficulty in the right management of our ſelves in every Condition, whether proſperous or afflicted:</hi> For there are particular Difficulties proper to both, as <hi>Agur</hi>'s Prayer againſt Riches and Poverty does import.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In a proſperous Condition, it is very hard to get our hearts throughly mortified to the Enjoyments of it.</hi> The ſavour and reliſh of the things of God is often inſenſibly abated and loſt very much, in a confluence of this World's delights. Men that are poſſeſſed of a great deal of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Wealth, are mighty prone to place their Felicity in it, and ſet their Hearts upon it. If we compare <hi>ver.</hi> 23, and 24. here in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, it will teach us, That 'tis hard to have Riches, and not to truſt in them; hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on God as truly then, as if we had them not. The Holy Ghoſt very well knew the need which there is of giving ſuch a charge to them that <hi>are rich in this World,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was able to make a Judgment from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, tells us the rich Man's thoughts; <hi>His Wealth is his ſtrong City, and an high Wall in his own Conceit, Prov.</hi> 18.11. And though <hi>Job</hi> could purge himſelf in this caſe, that <hi>he had not made Gold his hope or Confidence, Chap.</hi> 31.24. yet he was a Man that few could match him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Character which God gives of him twice, <hi>That there was none like him in all the earth, Chap.</hi> 1.8, 1, 2.3.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:41523:106"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In a afflicted Condition, 'tis hard to get up our Hearts to ſuch a chearful Frame, and keep them in it, as the Word calls for.</hi> A meek and a quiet Spirit under Sufferings, is an Ornament to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, but this is not enough: The Believers in Scripture, that were ſet forth for our Examples, went higher; and we find it difficult to reach that which they exceeded. We are ready to think our ſelves good Proficients, if we have our Paſſions ſo far ſubdued, as to be calm and ſtill, not to rage and fret; to forbear complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repining; but how much harder is it to give thanks, and bleſs the Name of the Lord, in and for Diſtreſſes? How much harder to Glory and take Pleaſure in Infirmities, and to be <hi>exceeding joyful in all our tribulation?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. This is ſo unnatural, to be glad of that which is moſt grievous to the Fleſh, to glorifie the Lord in the Fires, and and bear the heavieſt Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as valuable Mercies, that the performance cannot be eaſie.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>There is the difficulty of living in the higheſt Exerciſe of every Grace, with the deepeſt Humility.</hi> This is as neceſſary as any thing that can be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and yet perhaps the hardeſt of all; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt the beſt Duty, and the worſt Sin (as one excellently ſays) are both alike; and as the Proſperity of Fools deſtroys them, and their fulleſt Tables are their greateſt Snares; ſo not only our Sins, but our Duties may undo us, and will if they puff us up; and yet how apt are we to ſwell, when we have gone through any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in a tolerable manner? How few are there, in whom the lively Actings of Grace do not abate the ſenſe of their Vileneſs, almoſt as much as the workings of Corruption encreaſe it? As
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41523:106"/>there are too many in the World that count this Doctrine abſurd, ſo I am perſwaded, that of all who are in Chriſt, there are none but what find the Practice difficult. 'Tis hard to walk very exactly with God, and yet to walk very humbly; to do with all our might, and yet entirely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it when we have done, and mention no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it; to be rich in good Works, and yet as Beggars to live upon God's Free Gift, and with holy Self-denial to return that Anſwer to Chriſt, <hi>Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungry, and fed thee?</hi> The remanants of Spiritual Pride in every one of us, makes this very hard; the greateſt in Chriſt's Kingdom ſhould be the leaſt in their own Eyes, but 'tis not very eaſie for them ſo to be.</p>

               <p n="2">II. <hi>HOW muſt the overcoming of all theſe Difficulties be reſolv'd into the Power of the Grace of God?</hi> This may be open'd under two diſtinct Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a gracious ſupernatural Power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Believers, and inherent in them.</hi> Two Things here ſhould be a little clear'd, that Believers have ſuch a Power inherent in them, and that 'tis communicated to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Believers have ſuch a Power inherent in them.</hi> This is evident, and beyond all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; For,</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:41523:107"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hence they are denominated ſtrong;</hi> 1 John 2.14. To be ſtrong, and yet utterly deſtitute and void of Power, is a perfect contradiction. <hi>Abraham</hi> was particularly commended for <hi>Strength of Faith, Rom.</hi> 4.20. And who knows not that Faith is a Work fulfilled in us?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If the Children of God have no inhaerent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then the New-birth makes no Difference, between them and others, or between them and themſelves before they were Born again.</hi> An unregenerate State is deſcrib'd by being <hi>without Strength,</hi> Rom. 5.6. And is a regenerate State ſo too? Is a Man as weak, when he is made <hi>alive to God,</hi> as when he was <hi>dead in Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If Believers have no Power, then they are not chargeable with the Sin of ſpiritual Sloth; which they are ſo often incident to, and in Scripture accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of,</hi> Iſa. 64.7. <hi>There is none that ſtirreth up himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein does ſlothfulneſs conſiſt, but in not exerting and employing the Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties given us? And yet how can this be, if we have none to uſe or to put forth?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>What is any Grace indeed, but a Power gain'd over the contrary Corruption?</hi> The Spirit luſting againſt the Fleſh, and the Law of the Mind warring at leaſt (and for the moſt Part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing alſo) againſt the Law of the Members? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. is verified in Believers; <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you.</hi> Now where Sin loſes the Dominion, Grace aſſumes it; and all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ſuppoſes Power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That this Power is communicated to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, though inhaerent in them.</hi> They cannot vaunt themſelves upon this account, becauſe the Spring and Original of it is not in themſelves. They could have no more Power againſt Sin
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41523:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Satan, except it were given them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, then <hi>Pilate</hi> had againſt Chriſt. <hi>The God of Iſrael is he that giveth Strength and Power unto his People,</hi> Pſalm 68.35. He is the Fountain that diſpenſes it, they are but as the Ciſterns that receive it. 'Tis ingratitude not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Gift, 'tis abominable Pride, to deny the Giver. Believers have ſuch a Principle within them, but 'tis infuſed, not acquired; their Strength is in Part recovered, not by their own Means or Praevious endeavours, but by a Divine Vertue and Influence let out upon their Souls. The Spirit that dwelleth in us as Men, is a Spirit of Infirmity, the New Spirit which is given us as Believers, is a Spirit of Power. This we are neither to diſown, nor to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate; the Holy Ghoſt lays down this Truth with Caution againſt both Extreams, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not that we arer ſufficient of our ſelves, as of our ſelves, but all our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> He does not ſay, we have no ſufficiency abſolutely, but we have none of our ſelves, God is the Author of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is an unexhauſted Power to which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may and muſt have recourſe for further Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> This is that, which beſides the Grace already given, the Scripture calls <hi>Grace to help in Time of Need,</hi> upon every particular Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Occaſions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. There is no Time wherein we do not need more Grace from God to draw out the Grace we have into Exerciſe, and to maintain it in Exerciſe alſo, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Be ſtrong in the Grace, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The fulneſs of Grace which is treaſur'd up in our Bleſſed Lord, muſt Relieve and Supply the defects of that Grace which is in us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41523:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribes his more abundant Labours, <hi>Not to the Grace in him, but to the Grace of God which was with him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. As we have neceſſity enough for all the Strength receiv'd, ſo our Caſe and Condition in this World re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a greater Strength to accompany and concur with us. This the Apoſtle ſtiles in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place, <hi>The Power of Chriſt reſting upon him,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. The Word ſignifies Dwelling as in a Tent over him; as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>God's hiding him in his Pavilion,</hi> Pſalm. 27.5. Such a Screen and Defence was the Power of Chriſt to <hi>Paul;</hi> Chriſt was the Subject of this Power, <hi>Paul</hi> the Object; Chriſt poſſeſt it, <hi>Paul</hi> had the benefit of it. And in a ſober Sence, that which is for our Advantage may be called ours; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is enjoyed by us, though not lodg'd in us. As when God had aſſured <hi>Gideon</hi> of his Preſence, <hi>The Lord is with thee,</hi> Judg. 6.12. He is bidden to <hi>go in this his might,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s main Strength lay not in his being a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Man, but in his being aſſiſted by the mighty God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>To what End ſhould they that are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally furniſht with an Holy Gracious Power for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Services, have recourſe notwithſtanding to this Infinite Power of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>There is a Threefold End to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſecure the being of Grace; for Grace is the Workmanſhip of God, and not God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot ſupport it ſelf, nor ſtand without lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him.</hi> The innate Strength of the New Creature is not the Foundation of a Saints Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance; for if he were not <hi>kept by the Power of God, he would be lost at last,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. He
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41523:109"/>is kept by it from his Converſion to his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the firſt beginning of his Confidence, till he hath receiv'd the End of his Faith; or elſe the ſtrongeſt Grace in the World would fail.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To carry on the Improvement of Grace.</hi> A Believers Diligence will never add to his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if God do not lift up his Head. Inſtead of getting more Strength (which he ſhould daily do) he will rather leſſen what he hath, and grow weaker than he was. But when God comes in with his Auxiliary Force, they that were ready to halt and go back, make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Progreſs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.49. <hi>He giveth Power to the faint, and to them that have no might, he increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In order to the vigorous Employment of Grace.</hi> As Chriſt ſaid of the Damſel, <hi>She is not dead, but ſleepeth;</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of many Chriſtians, they are alive, but not awake; they are too drouſie and ſluggiſh in their Courſe of Duty. But when freſh help is given in from Eternal Power, what lively Acts do gracious Habits produce! How nimbly do we move in our walk with God! As the Prophet ſays, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.19. <hi>The Lord God is my Strength, and he will make my Feet, like Hinds Feet;</hi> i. e. ſwift and unwearied.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Why must the overcoming of the Difficulties of Salvation be thus reſolv'd into the Power of God's Grace?</hi> What Reaſon is there for the placing of all upon that one Bottom?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The highest and most perfect Creatures have miſcarried, when they stood in their own Strength; the Strength with which they were endow'd at their first Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:41523:109"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Angels, the highest rank of Creatures, and in a most perfect State, fell from Heaven.</hi> Though they excell'd in Strength, yet we ſee, it was not enough to bear them up without confirming Grace. They that always beheld the Face of God, lift up their Heels againſt him, and wickedly revolted from him. They that were the Top of the Creation, are ſunk into an horrible Pit; they that were greater in Power and Might than any of the Things which God made beſides, have betrayed their dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous weakneſs by a foul and ſinal Apoſtacy. 'Tis the harder to explain and give an account of their Fall, becauſe they ſinn'd without a Temper. They had no Inſtigation to Evil from without themſelves; and yet we find the mutability of their Natures was enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, becauſe they were not, like the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Angels, their Companions, and the reſt of their Kind, eſtabliſhed in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam, who was alſo made upright, after the Holy Image of God, without the least Bent or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in his Soul to Evil, fell nevertheleſs.</hi> That we, the Poſterity of the firſt Man, whoſe Natures are already corrupted, and ſtrongly byaſs'd with indwelling Sin, ſhould run into all manner of Abominations, unleſs God reſtrain us, is no wonder; but it ſeems ſtrange, that our pure and ſinleſs Parents, that had ſuch a ſtock of Righteouſneſs to live upon, ſhould ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and ſo quickly offend. How plainly does this ſhew, that a Creature (before a Sinner) given to change, cannot carry ſufficient Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives from Sin within it ſelf? Was the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſtanding ſo ſoon loſt by innocent Man, and do any of his ſinful Race expect to regain
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41523:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>it, and raiſe up themſelves without being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold'n to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The best and eminentest Saints have most manifestly felt, and readily own'd their neceſſary Dependance upon the Power of the Grace of God.</hi> It may be, ſome young and raw Converts may be too raſh and confident at firſt; their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations go a great deal beyond their Strength, and they think they can do or ſuffer any thing for Chirſt, like fooliſh Children, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to uſe their Legs, that venture further than they can with Safety, but grow more wary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. So here Babes in Chriſt, being tranſported by the heat of their firſt Love, forget many Times how feeble and infirm they are, till God by leaving them, gives them ſome afflicting Proofs of it. But the moſt ſolid, well grown Chriſtians, that are judicious as well as affectionate, that have tryed their Strength oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and conſider'd Things better, that have really profited more in Religion, and attained nearer to the Reſurrection of the Dead, theſe are always the moſt apprehenſive of the Truth I am now upon. God's eldeſt Children, and that are of all others the fitteſt for Enjoyment of their glorious Inheritance, do ſtill perceive, and are apt moſt freely to confeſs themſelves uncapable of yielding Holy Obedience, without Supplies of Power from the Spirit of Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us the Report in an Hour of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; though he had been caught up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above fourteen Years before, yet when he came down again, was like to be over-born by the buffettings of Satan, if God had not held him up. That Anſwer which Chriſt gave him, was all his Support, or elſe that choſen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41523:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>had been broken in Pieces, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 9. <hi>He ſaid to me, My Grace is ſufficient for thee, my Strength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If both the Deſire and the Performance in all ſpiritual Caſes be the Effects of God's mighty Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then all muſt be reſolved into his Power; for the Deſires and Performances take in all.</hi> Phil. 2.13. <hi>It is God which worketh in you, both to Will and to Do,</hi> &amp;c. If he Works in us theſe two Things, a fixed Inclination to good, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Execution of it, what is it that he does not Work?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God Works the Will; all Holy Deſires are by his Operation,</hi> Pſalm 110.3. <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the Day of thy Power.</hi> 'Tis he that roots out our ſinful Averſions and Reluctancies with his ſtrong Hand. The changing and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and new moulding of the Heart is the ſole Work of him that faſhioned it at firſt. None can prevail upon the Soul to chuſe and affect, what it naturally abhors, and flies from, but only he.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God Works the Deed; all Holy Performances, are the proper Fruits of his efficacious Influence alſo.</hi> This is undeniable, for in whatſoever Caſe that influence is withdrawn, though the Will continues, the Deed is wanting. Though he hath wrought in us to Will what we ſhould do, yet we cannot do what we ſhould and would. Is not <hi>Paul,</hi> and every Believer in the World, a clear Inſtance of this? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>To Will is preſent with me, but how to perform,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I find not.</hi> We deſire to do a great deal better than we attain to do. <hi>David</hi> took Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Duty, and yet craves Ability for it, as a further additional Gift. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.35. <hi>Make
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41523:111"/>me to go in the Path,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for therein do I delight.</hi> Though the Way be moſt delightful, we muſt go in God's Strength.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Tenour of the New Covenant puts this Point out of Doubt, that the Difficulties of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are to be overcome by the Power of God's Grace only.</hi> The Law (which is our Rule of Duty, and to be obſerv'd as ſuch, by thoſe that are in Chriſt) requires Things above our Strength, but God in this Covenant of Grace, Promiſes what he requires; and undertakes for what he demands. The Things which he enjoins us to do, he ſays, He will enable us to do; which plainly implies, that without his powerful help they could never be done; for, why ſhould God vainly and needleſly engage to interpoſe in a Matter, which might be done as well, though he ſtood afar off, and contributed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards it? Does God fear (as <hi>Joab</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated to <hi>David</hi> concerning <hi>Rabbah, when he fought againſt it,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.28.) <hi>leſt we ſhould take the City, and ſo it ſhould be called after our Name?</hi> I mean, does God-fear, leſt we ſhould do all our ſelves, and ſo run away with all the Honour? No ſurely, God's Glory may be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly ſnatcht and ſtolen from him, but it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be juſtly won or gotten by us; and therefore God's gracious Promiſes are convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Man's utter Impotency to any ſpiritual good; his Commands do not more plainly ſignifie our Obligation to Duty, than his Promiſes do our Weakneſs in Diſcharging it When God bids us walk in his Statutes, that ſhews how we are bound to do it; when he ſays, <hi>he will Cauſe us to walk in them,</hi> Ezek. 36.27. This ſhows, that we are not able of our ſelves to do it.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:41523:111"/>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> There are ſeveral Things which we may from hence be informed of, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There are ſome things which we may be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of from hence.</hi> As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They make very light of Salvation, who think to work it out by their own Power.</hi> They cannot ſuppoſe it to be a difficult Thing, but that which may be atchiev'd with little labour or trouble. And whereas the Principles of thoſe who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all to the Grace of God are charg'd with countenancing of lazineſs and looſeneſs, it may much rather be retorted upon thoſe who hold the contrary Opinions. Such as aſcribe all to themſelves, are the Perſons that take leaſt Care and Pains in the Matters of Religion; as if God's Children were born without Travail, and the Kingdom of Heaven taken without Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. Men that Judge after the Fleſh, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indeed be imagin'd to Judge otherwiſe; <hi>For the Eyes of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding muſt be enlighten'd, that we may know what is the exceeding greatneſs of his Power,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18, 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Our ſpiritual Adverſaries would find no Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in destroying us, if we were left alone.</hi> We have ſo little might againſt them, that we ſhould be an eaſie Prey to them, if we had not one to ſtand by us, who is infinitely mightier than they. The Devils believe this Doctrine which the Pride of Man oppoſes; they know they can out-do and over-match us, if we had not Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence on our ſide. When our Lord tells <hi>Peter, that Satan deſired to have him,</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41523:112"/>is, that he would have tried a ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with him, unguarded by the powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, for that was it which turn'd the Scale and prevented <hi>Peter</hi>'s over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. Poor Believers are as much deſpis'd by the Powers of Darkneſs, as <hi>Gideon</hi>'s young Son was by the two Kings of <hi>Midian, Zelah,</hi> and <hi>Zalumnah,</hi> Judg. 8.21. <hi>Job</hi> himſelf would not have come off with ſo much Honour and Victory as he did, if God had not <hi>put Strength into him,</hi> Chap. 23.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This hints the true Reaſon to us, how it comes to paſs that the ſame Believers are baffled by ſome Difficulties, and yet Triumph over others.</hi> What hardſhips is a Child of God carried through, and made more than Conquerour over at one Time, who at another Time is almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd, and his Courage gone! How does God at one Time help us to bear the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of greater Plenty without being hurt by it, than we can at another Time? As the Net which was let down at Chriſts Command <hi>broke with the multitude of Fiſhes,</hi> Luke 5.6. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reſurruction, Chriſt orders the Draught as before, and ſo many were caught, that they could not pull them to the Shore, <hi>John</hi> 21.6. <hi>And yet the Net was not broken,</hi> v. 11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>How vaſtly does Grace make us to differ from what we are by Nature! I am a Child,</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.6. Eaſily ſhaken and thrown down; but what ſays God, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Behold I have made Thee this Day a defenced City, and an Iron Pillar and brazen Walls,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Without me you can do nothing,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>I can do
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41523:112"/>all Things through Christ that strengthens me,</hi> ſays <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 4.13. What a Difference is here? So great, that there cannot be a greater; <hi>doing nothing,</hi> and <hi>doing all things.</hi> Such is a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a ſorry naked Man, and a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtaining help of God. Though our own Right Hand cannot ſave us, the Lord at our Right Hand will ſave, ſo as none ſhall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The beſt Aſſiſtance we can give to any of our Brethren in Soul-troubles and ſtraits, is leading them to the Rock, thats higher than our ſelves.</hi> We are vain helpers, except we do as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 23.16. <hi>Strengthen one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's Hands in God.</hi> 'Tis our Duty to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the feeble-minded, and ſupport the weak,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.14. But how ſhall we do this? By ſhewing them where the Strength of Salvation is. So the Prophet expounds the Apoſtle, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.3, 4. <hi>Strengthen you the weak Hands, confirm the feeble Knees;</hi> ſay to them that are of a fearful Heart, <hi>be ſtrong, fear not;</hi> behold your God will come and ſave you. Holy <hi>David</hi> was very Ambitious of doing this Service to the World; <hi>viz. Shewing God's Strength to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and his Power to every one that was to come,</hi> Pſalm 71.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There are ſome Things which from hence we ſhould be exhorted to.</hi> As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>You who have liv'd all your Days in Sin, repair to Almighty Grace for Cure.</hi> The oldeſt Sores are heal'd by Chriſt, as well as the freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wounds. He is an able Phyſician, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41523:113"/>though your Caſe would puzzle every one elſe, he will certainly recover you. Diſeaſes of the longeſt Continuance, how ſtubborn ſoever, are eaſily helpt and remov'd by him. <hi>He looſed the Woman, whom Satan had hound eighteen Years,</hi> Luke 13.16. <hi>He made the Man whole, that had an Infirmity thirty eight Years,</hi> John 5.5. His Miracles of Grace are wrought not only on Young Sinners, but many Times Elder Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When you are brought into a State of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, think of the remainder of your Work without uncomfortable Terror.</hi> The Difficulties in our Paſſage to Heaven oftentimes breed too much Affrightment; as the Soul of the People in their Journeying through the Wilderneſs to <hi>Canaan, was diſcouraged becauſe of the Way,</hi> Numb. 21.4. They had little Reaſon for this, whom God had already deliver'd out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and the like may be ſaid of you, whom God hath with a mighty and out-ſtretched Arm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued from the very brink of Hell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let Everlaſting Strength be a Motive to your Everlaſting Truſt.</hi> Iſa. 26.4. As <hi>Martha</hi> ſaid to Chriſt concerning her Siſter, <hi>That had left her to ſerve alone; bid her that ſhe help me,</hi> Luke 10.40. So do you boldly claim God's promiſed Aſſiſtance at the Throne of Grace, where you cannot be more (humbly) Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, than Welcome. Intermitting of a ſteady Reliance upon him, is as much your Folly and Sin, as preſuming on your ſelves. What can be meant by that Precept, of <hi>being ſtrong in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. If we may not take hold
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41523:113"/>of God's Strength, and uſe it as freely as if it were our own? While others <hi>faint, and are weary, and utterly fall, you that wait upon the Lord</hi> (i. e. continue depending) <hi>ſhall renew your Strength,</hi> Iſa. 40.30, 31.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Look upon it as your abſolute Duty to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of nothing that needs to be done either for or by you.</hi> Your own inſufficiency is no Plea for doubting in any Caſe whatever. <hi>Let the weak ſay, I am ſtrong,</hi> Joel 3.10. <hi>Paul</hi> is our Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, he did ſay ſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſpeaks in very large and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Terms upon this Subject, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Strengthened with all might according to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Power, unto all Patience,</hi> &amp;c. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. Here's a remarkable heap of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as Mr. <hi>Trail</hi> very well Notes, <hi>pag.</hi> 236.) All Grace firſt in God, and that abounding towards us; and then as the reſult of it, our having a ſufficiency, and All-ſufficiency, and that always, and in all Things, and thence flows every good Work, and our abounding to every good Work.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>You who are Believers, and conſequently to whom all Things are thus poſſible, ſtudy all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi> What a Debtor is he to God, whoſe Strength is in him. According as his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power hath given Relief to you, make ſuitable returns to him. The Man that had been Lame from his Mother's Womb, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as he <hi>receiv'd Strength and ſtood up, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with the Apoſtles into the Temple, leaping and praiſing God,</hi> Acts 3.7, 8. Thus <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>The Lord is my Strength, and my
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41523:114"/>Shield, my Heart truſted in him, and I am help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore my Heart greatly rejoyceth, and with my Song will I Praiſe him,</hi> Pſalm 28.7. To Conclude therefore, as your help comes from Heaven, ſo let your Praiſes go up thither. Remember every renewed Experience calls for a repeated Acknowledgement; and there may be equal Danger of obſtructing God's mighty workings by ingratitude, and by unbelief; both tend to with-hold his Hand, and enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ours.</p>

               <p>THough the Title of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> Points us to the Author [<hi>a Pſalm of</hi> David] yet much of the Matter makes it plain, that he is not the only, nor the principal Subject. The main Subſtance of the whole agrees well enough to <hi>David,</hi> and he might have an Eye in it to his own perſonal Afflictions, but yet his Thoughts and Expreſſions were ſo directed by the Holy Ghoſt, as to be more fully and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly verified in Chriſt, of whom he was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Type, than in himſelf. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Remarkable Paſſages which have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reſpect to Chriſt, and to put it beyond all Doubt, that this was the meaning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Spirit of God in them, they are ſo applied in the New Teſtament.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23. is applied, not to <hi>David</hi>'s Enemies, but to the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon their Rejection by God, for the Crucifying of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.9, 10. and ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 25. is ſaid to be fulfill'd in <hi>Judas</hi> for betraying him, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20. But we need to go no further for an Inſtance of this kind, than the beginning of this verſe, which is Cited by our Lord himſelf, as ſpoken with Reference to his Caſe, <hi>John</hi> 15.25. <hi>They hated me without a Cauſe.</hi> Only what is contracted in the Citation, is here deliver'd more at large, where we have four Things diſtinctly ſet forth, concerning the Enemies of Jeſus Chriſt; their Iniquity, Malignity, Number and Power.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Their Iniquity;</hi> they were <hi>[cauſeleſs haters of him]</hi> and <hi>[his Enemies wrongfully]</hi> they had no juſt or real Ground for what they did, no Provocation to do it; they were his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for his good Works, not for any Evil ones; and that which ſhould have rather engag'd their Affection to him, was the occaſion of their Oppoſition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Their Malignity; [they that would deſtroy me]</hi> they ſought no leſs than his Life, they thirſted after his Blood; that which was indeed neceſſary to be ſhed, for the accompliſhing of the Holy Ends of God, theſe wicked Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would not be Content without; ſo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Rage was over-rul'd to bring about the Divine Purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Their Number;</hi> they <hi>[are more than the Hairs of my Head]</hi> the whole Multitude of the <hi>Jews</hi> were for deſtroying him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.20,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41523:115"/>&amp;c. And truly, every Man in the World, that is without Chriſt, is againſt him. He hath as many Adverſaries, as there are Men in a natural unconverted State.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Their Power.</hi> They <hi>[are mighty]</hi> ſo it was foretold that they would be; <hi>The Kings of the Earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt,</hi> Pſalm 2.2. Which <hi>Peter</hi> cites, as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with Relation to our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.26. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>That none of the Frinces of this World knew him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. And being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of him, no wonder that they oppoſe him. Antichriſt hath more of the Potentates of the Earth on his ſide, than Chriſt ever had. But that which I intend to inſiſt upon, is what the Pſalmiſt adds in the cloſe of the verſe. <hi>[Then I reſtored that which I took not away]. Then,</hi> when he was ſo beſet and ſurrounded with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, who were worrying him to Death; then, <hi>when the Waters were come into his Soul; when he ſunk in the deep mire, and the Floods over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd him; when his Throat was dryed, and his Eyes failed,</hi> ver. 1, 2, 3. Which are all ſo many various Phraſes to denote the Extremity of thoſe Soul-troubles that our Lord Jeſus was plung'd into, by Reaſon of the Wrath of God let out againſt him, as well as the Wrath of Man. Then, he <hi>reſtored that which he took not away;</hi> he was not forc'd or conſtrain'd to do it, but he did it willingly with his free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; he was under no Obligation to do it, but what he took upon himſelf; the Law binds a Man indeed to make Reſtitution of that <hi>which he hath taken away,</hi> Lev. 6.4. But the Lord of the Law could not be bound to reſtore that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41523:116"/>which he had not taken, in order to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Peace and Reconciliation between God and the Sinner, this was graciouſly undertaken and perform'd by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Obſ. <hi>It was the great and bleſſed Work of our Lord Jeſus here upon the Earth, to reſtore what he took not away.</hi> In handling this,

                     <item>I. Shew, what is it, which was taken away, and from whom?</item>
                     <item>II. Wherein it appears that Chriſt took it not away.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>What is it which was taken away, and from whom?</hi> For 'tis manifeſtly implied, that there was ſomething unjuſtly taken, or elſe what need of any Reſtitution? As to God, there was Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry taken from him; and as to Man, there was Righteouſneſs, Holineſs and Happineſs taken from him alſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There was Glory taken from God.</hi> Not his eſſential Glory, nor any Perfection of his Being, for that cannot be taken away, but that Glory which ſhines forth in the Moral Government of his Creatures, and that Glory, which we are tied to give to him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Glory of God ſhining forth in the Holy Government of his reaſonable Creatures, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by Sin.</hi> It was preſerv'd and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the upper World indeed, among the ſtanding Angels, but among fallen Men in this lower World, it was intirely loſt. It was for our
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:41523:116"/>Makers Honour, to have the Man whom he had made after his Image, live in perfect Subjection to his Will; but when Man caſt off the Yoke of his Obedience, though God's Authority and Right remained, the exerciſe of it by actual rule was interrupted. He was a King ſtill, but of diſorderly Rebels, that inſtead of kiſſing his Scepter, renounc'd him, and bid defiance to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Glory which we are tied to give to God, was withheld by ſin.</hi> There is a revenue of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry due from us to God, which ſin tends to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and deprive him of, and ſo the Devil takes the Advantage, and ſeizes it for himſelf. Every ſin is upon this account a committing of Theft; 'tis robbing of God of the Honour which we owe to him. We ought to Glorifie him with all we have, with every Faculty and Member, but the Sinner on the contrary vilifies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches him by the abuſe of all. Such was and is the ſtate of Mankind without Chriſt. We do not only come ſhort of the Glory of God, but we attempt to cut his Glory ſhort. As much as in us lies, we make God contemptible, throw Dirt upon his Name, and ſet him at nought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There was Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs taken from Man alſo.</hi> He was a real loſer in all theſe reſpects, being once in poſſeſſion of all, but caſt out of it by ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There was a loſs of Righteouſneſs to the Guilty Sinner.</hi> So long as <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood, while his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nakedneſs was no ſhame to him, he was inwardly cover'd with a Robe of Righteouſneſs; but Satan alluring him into ſin, ſtrip'd him of his Garment, and cloath'd him with Confuſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it. As God made him in his firſt Eſtate
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41523:117"/>he was a perfectly juſt Perſon, and could ſtand in the Judgment before God; but when his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity was removed from him, Guilt was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately contracted, and he fell into Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, under the Sentence of the Law which he had broken. And now till Chriſt repairs this Loſs for us, the Divine Tribunal is very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; <hi>For in God's ſight no man living can be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Pſal. 143.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There was a loſs of Holineſs to the polluted Sinner.</hi> The Image of God in Man was defac'd, the Divine Nature deſtroyed, and all the Habits of Grace extinguiſh'd; the good Treaſure of the Heart was turned into an evil one, filled with the Seeds and Principles of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Corruption. <hi>Every one of them is gone back,</hi> (degenerated from what they originally were, when they came out of God's Hands) <hi>they are altogether become filthy,</hi> Pſal. 53.3. Men are now by Nature ſo void of the leaſt Relicks or Remembrances of their primitive Purity, that they are inſenſible of their preſent Defilement. They are ſo blinded with their own Mire, that they think themſelves clean, till Chriſt hath anointed them with his Spirit and waſhed them in his Blood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There was a loſs of Happineſs to the miſerable Sinner. Adam</hi>'s Expulſion out of an Earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, though a real Puniſhment, was the leaſt part of what Sin render'd him obnoxious to. The Miſery of Man was much greater upon him in other Reſpects, as he was quite cut off from all Communion with God, made an Heir of Wrath, not only as to bodily, but ſpiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, of all ſorts, and not only in Time, but to Eternity. Upright Man was exempt, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41523:117"/>from all theſe, and placed in as Happy a Condition as a Creature could be out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but when Sin enter'd, Death enter'd with and by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. A Death which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of all the Calamities and Woes of both Worlds; till Chriſt came that we might have more abundant Life.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Wherein it appears that Chriſt did not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thoſe Things from either?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is plain, as to God, he never took away any Glory from him; for he never did any Thing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable or offenſive to God.</hi> John 8.29. <hi>I do always thoſe Things that pleaſe him.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.5. <hi>The Lord God hath opened mine Ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.</hi> Several of the Prophets did for a Time refuſe to go at God's call, and would have pluckt their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſhrunk their Necks, from the Work which he put upon them; as <hi>Moſes, Jeremy, Jonas,</hi> &amp;c. But our Lord Jeſus ſhew'd no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, delighting to do and ſuffer his Father's Will. The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> had none of that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enmity in his Nature, which all the reſt of the Poſterity of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> have; He was peculiarly <hi>that Holy Thing,</hi> from his very Birth, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. God's beloved Son, and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, throughout his Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is alſo clear as to Man, that he took not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any Rightcouſneſs, Holineſs or Happineſs from him.</hi> He was not ſuch a Fountain of Guilt, Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Miſery, as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had been, but the contrary (as we ſhall ſee afterwards.) The firſt Man poyſon'd, and ruin'd all his Seed, but he did not ſo to the Children which God had given him. His Converſation was not only
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41523:118"/>blameleſs, and harmleſs, but uſeful and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary. He did no Violence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.9. <hi>But he went about doing good,</hi> Acts 10.38. Whatever was injurious to Men, he vindicates himſelf from; <hi>When the Diſciples call'd for Fire from Heaven to conſume the Samaritans,</hi> he tells them, <hi>that he came not to deſtroy men's Lives, but to ſave them,</hi> Luke 9.56. When the Woman taken in Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was brought to him, he would not condemn her, <hi>but bids her go and Sin no more,</hi> John 8.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Scripture therefore ſpeaks of Chriſt's being cut off, but not for himſelf,</hi> Dan. 9.26. Though he ſuffered in his own Perſon, he did not ſuffer on his own Account; <hi>Christ bath once ſuffered for ſins, the just for the unjust,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. Sin was indeed the cauſe of his Suffering, but not any ſin committed by himſelf; he was the juſt One, we were the unjuſt, on whoſe behalf he underwent all that was laid upon him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4, 5. <hi>Surely he hath born our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows.—He was wounded for our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and bruiſed for our Iniquities.</hi> He ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that of which we were guilty; he made reparation for the Wrongs which we had done; he diſcharged the Debts which we contracted, and endur'd the Wrath which we provoked, and drunk of the Cup which we had filled.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Innocency of Christ was conſpicuous in his very Sufferings. Though they found no cauſe of Death in him, yet deſired they Pilate that he ſhould be ſlain,</hi> Acts 13.28. He that gave Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, did firſt give Sentence for him; he pronounc'd him Faultleſs on the Bench, before he deliver'd him up to Execution. When they went to apprehend him, they came out <hi>as againſt a Thief,</hi> Matth. 26.55. they proceeded againſt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41523:118"/>him as a Malefactor, and numbred him with Tranſgreſſors, but could not prove any Article of their <hi>Charge</hi> againſt him, ſo much as by the agreeing Teſtimony of their Mercenary Perjured Witneſſes. That which they alledged with greateſt truth was, that <hi>he made himſelf the Son of God,</hi> John 19.7. <hi>i. e.</hi> equal with God, as they underſtood it, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.18. (However the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> would mince that Expreſſion now) but this was far from a Criminal Accuſation, or a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Reaſon why he ſhould die, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; <hi>For being in the form of God,</hi> (of the ſame infinite Eſſence) <hi>he counted it no Robbery to be equal with God,</hi> Phil. 2.6.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>How did Chriſt reſtore thoſe things which he took not away?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>In General, by his Active and Paſſive Obedience;</hi> for both are concern'd in this matter, and contribute their joint influence towards the great and bleſſed Work, of which I am now ſpeaking. As will appear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Christ's doing of the Will of God in ſuch a manner as he did it, was a greater Honour to God, than ever had been, or could be done before.</hi> He did it in the moſt exact and ſinleſs manner; the Law of God in his Heart, and copied out in his Actions, was as perfect as it is in it ſelf. The Commandment, though exceeding broad, was not wider than his performance of it. This could never be ſaid of any of the Sons of Men before, ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> for there is ſtill a large mixture of Evil with all the Good they do, and their beſt and compleat Duties will not bear weighing in an even Balance. And as to <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, before he fell, in his ſtate of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41523:119"/>Uprightneſs, there was a vaſt diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Obedience, and the Obedience of Chriſt. What compariſon between the ſervice of a Day, and a whole Life! What compariſon between the Act of a Creature, and the Acts of the Son of God! There was more Glory brought to God by his Son's being his Servant but for one moment, than by all the Angels in Heaven, and Men on Earth being ſo for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ's ſuffering of the Will of God, made a conſiderable addition to the Glory of God, which had been impaired by the ſin of Man.</hi> Hebr. 5.8. <hi>Tho' he were a Son, yet learned he Obedience by the things which he ſuffered.</hi> This was admirable; He that teaches Obedience to us, and requires it of us, learn'd it himſelf, and he learn'd it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally; for to learn to obey, is to obey: It was a Leſſon which he practiſed, and it was an harder Leſſon than in caſes where he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd to do, for it was by the things that he ſuffered. This he refers to in that laſt famous Prayer of his, <hi>John</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on the Earth, I have finiſh'd the Work,</hi> &amp;c. The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of his Work was by dying; this crown'd all that he had done and undergone before, and therefore this was the moſt eminent and ſignal inſtance of his glorifying God. Therefore when <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytor was gone out, Chriſt breaks forth, <hi>Now is God glorified in me; now the hour is coming,</hi> John 13.31. Now all his Attributes, Precepts, Promiſes, Threatnings, are about to be made more illuſtrious by my Death, than ever they have been.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt hath provided for the Juſtification of the Sinner, by the Obedience which he fulfilled. By the Obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41523:119"/>Rom.</hi> 5.8. Our Lord Jeſus is this One, and Believers are thoſe many; all ſoand and true Believers, whether ſtrong or weak. One Chriſt is able to juſtifie many; God hath declared, That what he hath done, is enough for this purpoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. Yea it is more pleaſing and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to God, than if every one of theſe many had done what the Law calls for from them in their own Perſons. As Chriſt appear'd in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>John,</hi> with a Garment down to the Feet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13. ſo the Robe of his Righteouſneſs is long and large enough to ſupply all the Defects of ours, and cover his whole Body. Here is a ſufficient ample Recompence for our former loſs; we gain a better in the room of what we had. The Righteouſneſs which ſin carried out, was a poor, mutable, temporary, fading thing; now <hi>an everlaſting Righteouſneſs is brought,</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. a Righteouſneſs which cannot be taken away, or by any means wreſted from us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Christ communicates that Grace, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our Sanctification alſo.</hi> He finds Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their Blood, but he does not leave them ſo; he finds them without God, but brings them to him; he finds them afar off. but makes them nigh; he finds them haters of God, and one another, but he plants love to both in their Hearts by his own Spirit: He <hi>purifies them to himſelf, Tit.</hi> 2.14. and forms himſelf in them. There are no partakers of Chriſt, but what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of God's Holineſs by him; they have no ſaving benefit from him, that are deſtitute of this; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.12. <hi>They ſhall call them, The holy People, theredeemed of the Lord.</hi> As Chriſt is the Author of Salvation to them that believe and obey him, ſo he is the Author of their Faith and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41523:120"/>their Obedience; we receive Grace from him in order to the receiving of him, and walking in him. There is no ſpiritual good thing that dwells in us, but what is the effect of Chriſt's dwelling there. Souls that are united to his Perſon, are ſupplied out of his fullneſs; and theſe are ſuch Supplies as ſhall never fail, or be cut off, while we have a being.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Jeſus Christ hath merited for us a preſent Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs in this World.</hi> This neceſſarily follows upon what hath been ſaid; for they that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in a juſtified and ſanctified State, muſt needs be in an happy State; more happy upon theſe accounts, than they can be miſerable upon any other. Where ſin is taken away, as to its damning Guilt, and ruling Power, no afflictive Evils can make us miſerable, but rather help to encreaſe our Happineſs; for the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie Providences are ſo ſanctified, that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than if they were eſcaped. 'Tis a Privilege which we owe to the Blood of Chriſt, that none of the Calamities of this Life ſhall hurt us, but all ſhall do us good; and 'tis far more deſirable to be kept in a Wilderneſs of Trouble under ſuch a Promiſe, than to be in a Paradice of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity without it. God deals with Believers as Children when he chaſtens them, with Sinners as Enemies when he ſhines upon them. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the whole Curſe,</hi> Gal. 3.13. from the Curſe of temporal Afflictions, as well as everlaſting Deſtruction. He was crowned with Thorns, as the Fruit of the Curſe here upon the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.18. to ſhew that hath born it for us, and born it away from us.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:41523:120"/>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Jeſus Christ hath procured for us a more full and abſolute Bleſſedneſs in the World to come.</hi> This is what we had forfeited all hopes of, and title to; but of him we have obtained this Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance again, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. Believers are made happy now by the earneſt of it, hereafter they will be more unconceivably happy in the actual compleat poſſeſſion. <hi>Whoſo eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, hath eternal Life,</hi> John 6.54. Eternal Life and Glory, is the very top and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt point, the head Stone, and the full blown Flower of a Creature's Felicity; when you have ſaid this, you can go no higher; now to aſſure us the more comfortably of our arrival to this at laſt, we have the pledges and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of it here; but the way of our receiving them is to be conſider'd: 'Tis by <hi>eating the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>drinking the Blood of Christ;</hi> by Faith in the Lamb ſlain, in our Paſſover Sacrific'd; for his Fleſh could not have been eaten, nor his Blood drunk, if he had not died. 'Tis the death of Chriſt which we muſt lay hold upon for Life and Salvation; the Kingdom which he appoints to us, is founded here; for (as one ſays) <hi>Chriſt hath purchaſed by his Death all the Legacies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd in his Teſtament, which no other Teſtator does.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Why did Jeſus Christ make it his Work to reſtore what he took not away?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It was a neceſſary work, a work which must be done, in order to his being a Saviour.</hi> God will have reſtitution made one way or another; his injur'd Name and Honour muſt be vindicated. <hi>It became him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in bringing many Sons unto glory</hi> (yea it would have become him, if he had
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41523:121"/>brought but one) <hi>to make the Captain of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perfect through ſufferings,</hi> Hebr. 2.10. It was agreeable to his Wiſdom, Purity, Truth, and Righteouſneſs, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould make compenſation by his Blood for the Iniquity of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. It was not fit, nor conſiſtent with the Perfections of Gods Nature, that ſuch Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

In the buſineſs of Salvation, there was ſomething elſe to be done, beſides the magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Grace; God had ſaid, that <hi>be would mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſie the Law, and make it honourable,</hi> Iſa. 42.21. This Law had been trampled on by every Child of Diſobedience, and therefore to aſſert and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Reputation of it, Chriſt muſt be made under it, perform what it enjoin'd, and ſuffer what it threatned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It was a work impoſſible for any meer Creature to do; ſo that if Chriſt did not, it could not have been done by any Perſon beſides him.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks of the wicked Oppreſſor, that he ſhall vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit up what he ſwallows down, <hi>and according to his ſubſtance ſhall the reſtitution be,</hi> Job 20.18. He ſhall refund to thoſe whom he hath drained by rapine and Violence, as far as his Eſtate will go. But what reſtitution can there be, when all the ſubſtance is waſted? This is our caſe; we are wretchedly poor, and inſolvent, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pay, being reduc'd by Sin to abſolute Beggary; we have ſtoln away (as far as was in our power) the Crown from God, and we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

We can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but we cannot reſtore: When the Servant that owed Ten thouſand Talents to his Lord, was brought before him, and could not pay his Debt, his Lord commanded him to be ſold, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.25. but alas! we are not worth ſo much as our Debt amounts to. If Juſtice ſhould ſeize us, it muſt detain us for ever; we muſt not only be caſt into Priſon, but kept there; and our lying in Hell for ever would not ſatisfy God, as Chriſt's ſuffering once upon the Croſs.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>JEſus Christ was ordained of God to this work, and in that reſpect there was a neceſſity of his accompliſhing it.</hi> John 9.4. <hi>I muſt work the work of him that ſent me,</hi> &amp;c. This was the work of him that ſent him, and therefore he could not decline it. Chriſt could not reſiſt the Will of the Father, any more than he could ceaſe to love him. <hi>John</hi> 14.31. <hi>That the World may know that I love the Father, as the Father gave me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, even ſo I do.</hi> His Obedience was an Evidence of his Love to God, as it is of ours; though there be no proportion between his and ours; for no Creatures love to God was ever ſo ſtrong, or ever ſo tried. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was ſtyled the Man that <hi>executed God's Counſel, Iſa.</hi> 46.11. but he did it ignorantly, for he knew not God; but the Man Chriſt Jeſus underſtood his Work, and who gave it him to do, and deſign'd the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41523:122"/>Execution of God's Counſel in it; as an Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his matchleſs Affection to him. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came our Lord Jeſus in the quality of God's Commiſſioner, <hi>To be faithful to him that appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him,</hi> Heb. 3.2. He was put in truſt with this Buſineſs, and he muſt ſhew his Fidelity in performing it. There is ſuch an exact Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between his and the Father's Will, that when God pleas'd to require his Service, he could not but ſay, <hi>Lo I come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt had engag'd to take this Work upon him; which is a ſort of Engagement that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, more than once expreſſes by ſtriking Hands,</hi> Job 17.3. Prov. 22.26. So our Lord Jeſus had covenanted with the Father before all Time, to do that which in the fulneſs of Time he actually came to do. Now this Agreement, which bears an Eternal Date, could not be diſanulled or made void again; as God the <hi>Father had ſworn with reſpect to Chriſt, and could not repent,</hi> Pſalm 110.4. So Jeſus Chriſt having enter'd into ſuch a Bond, it ſtood firm as the Ordinances of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he could not go back from the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Performance of it. If the Covenant of Redemption might have been broken, the whole Deſign might have miſcarried, the Counſel of Peace had been overthrown, and all the Thoughts of God to us-ward had come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It was upon this unmoveable Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Salvation of all the Believers under the Old Teſtament was built, as well as thoſe under the New; ſo that if Chriſt had not made good what he undertook, they that were let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, muſt have been caſt out. But the Conſidence that God repoſed in his Son could not be ſo defeated. <hi>He that ſweareth to his own
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41523:123"/>hurt and changeth not,</hi> is the Character of a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of <hi>Sion,</hi> Pſalm 15.4. But moſt eminently true of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Infinite Love of Chriſt to Sinners did ſweetly incline him to this Work. His Delights</hi> (who was the Wiſdom of God) <hi>were with the Sons of Men,</hi> Prov. 8.31. He delighted in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and in them as the needy Objects of it, who otherwiſe were altogether undelightful. The Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt were troubled for us; he could not bear to ſee his whole reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creation in this lower World, made a Prey to the Devil, without interpoſing for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Reſcue of a choſen peculiar Number. Our Miſery was the Motive to his Compaſſion; that ſwayed him to Acts of Pity, when our guilt would have provokt him to the utmoſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. <hi>This is that Love of Chriſt which paſſeth Knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3.19. A Love which is and will be the Matter of endleſs Admiration, which the saints in Heaven are always magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, but can never fully comprehend. 'Tis ſometimes called <hi>the Grace of our Lord Yeſus,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. Which is not meant of the Grace communicated to us, but that Grace in him, which is the Fountain and Spring of all ſuch Communications. We are not only to conſider the Love and Good-will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſending, but the exceeding Kindneſs of the Son in coming; which his Deſire of, and Zeal for our Salvation, promoted him to.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was willing not only to purchaſe a new Title for us to our forfeited Bleſſings, but to purchaſe a new Title to us for himſelf.</hi> This is expreſly ſaid to be one Part of his Intention and Deſign; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 9. <hi>To this end he both dyed,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:41523:123"/>and roſe and revived, that he might be Lord both of the Dead and Living.</hi> He was Lord of all upon the old Account of Creation, for he could not loſe his Propriety and Dominion; when <hi>Ahaz.</hi> Reign'd ſo wickedly and committed all manner of Abominations, and for that Reaſon <hi>was delivered into the Hand of the King of Syria,</hi> the Lord his God is ſaid to do it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.5. The Lord was his God by right ſtill, though he ſinfully renounc't and diſown'd him. But now. Jeſus Chriſt was reſolv'd to be our Lord upon a new Account of Redemption; that he might lay claim to us, not only as the Lord that made us, but as the Lord that bought us. <hi>We are now the ranſomed of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 35.10. <hi>His purchaſed Poſſeſſion,</hi> Eph. 1.14. By the Payment of the ſame ineſtimable Price he hath regain'd all that Sin and Satan had ſnatcht and torn from us, and likewiſe acquir'd a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Intereſt and Right in us, ſuch as will be acknowledg'd by all his ſaved ones to his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Praiſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The Powers of Darkneſs would have been Triumphant, if Chriſt had not baffled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated them by this glorious Perſormance.</hi> It was a great Satisfaction to their Malice and Rage, after they were baniſht out of Heaven, and caſt down to Hell, to involve all Mankind by one ſucceſsful Temptation in the ſame Ruine with themſelves, and ſo prevent God from rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in any of his Works on Earth. When Judgment was executed upon them never to be revers't, they thought it made ſome amends, that they had drawn the whole Poſterity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> at once into the fatal Snare. The Devil gloried over poor miſerable Man as his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41523:124"/>Vaſſal, and lawful Captive; having ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued this undone World to himſelf, as a kind of Tributary Province, where he might Drink his fill of the Blood of Souls. But this Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Chriſt hath diſappointed him of the Fruits of that Victory: <hi>For he hath divided the ſpoil with the Strong,</hi> Iſa. 53.12. <hi>And deſtroyed him that had the Power of Death,</hi> Heb. 2.14. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath pluckt his Sheep out of the Teeth of the Devourer, and pull'd down the Banners which he had ſet up, and made him give up his Slaves, as the Fiſh that had ſwallowed <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> vomited him alive upon dry Land.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Chriſt knew that his bleſſed Performance would not only be a Benefit to Man, but turn to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Elect Angels alſo.</hi> At the ſame Time that he came about reſtoring Work for us, he might alſo do confirming Work for them. And this their Caſe requir'd; Angels wanted an Head of ſtability, as well as Men a Mediator of recovery; they ſtood in need of his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as well as we of his Salvation; his Blood was neceſſary for us as actually fallen, his Strength neceſſary to them, becauſe naturally mutable. <hi>All Things in Heaven and Earth, were to be gather'd together in one, even in Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 1.10. They could not ſafely meet in any other Center, but ſo as to be in danger of being ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off again. We that had left our firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, were to be reduc'd and brought back to it; they that had kept their firſt Eſtate were to be fixt and eſtabliſht in it. Here was a double Work to be done by the ſame Hand; and the ſame Hand hath done both; Chriſt hath interpos'd for our Reſtauration, and for their Security; for the remedying of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41523:124"/>and the Prevention of theirs. The Heart of our dear Lord is ſet upon the multiplying of Acts of Grace, from the Throne to the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, that high and low may be taken in.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Information:</hi> Many Things to be learnt from hence. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If it were Chriſts Work to reſtore what he took not away, we may ſee a vaſt difference between him, and the beſt of thoſe that were Types of him.</hi> Some of the greateſt Types of Chriſt were in ſome Things contrary to him, as well as in all Things Inferiour. There was not a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Type of Chriſt in the Old Teſtament, than <hi>David,</hi> the Perſon ſpeaking in the Text, inſomuch that Chriſt is frequently ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Name, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. and in many other Places. Now this <hi>David</hi> was ſo far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Chriſt did, <hi>i. e, Reſtoring what he took not away,</hi> that he confeſſes the contrary of himſelf, in the Caſe of his numbring the People, for which ſeventy Thouſand of them dyed by the Peſtilence, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. <hi>He ſpake unto the Lord, when he ſaw the Angel that ſmote the People, and ſaid, Lo I have ſinned and done wickedly, but theſe Sheep what have they done? Let thy Hand I pray thee, be againſt me,</hi> &amp;c. Our Lord Jeſus might have inverted theſe Words; theſe Sheep have <hi>gone Aſtray</hi> indeed, and <hi>turned every one to his own Way,</hi> but what have I done? Let not thy Sword be awaken'd againſt me, but them. They have deſerv'd to ſuffer, but wherein have I offended? <hi>David</hi>'s Sin puniſht upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Sins of the People upon Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:41523:125"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The unſpotted Holineſs of our Lord Jeſus, is not in the leaſt blemiſht by the Imputation of our Sins to him.</hi> He is not at all the leſs guiltleſs in himſelf, becauſe our Iniquities are laid upon him. We may with ſufficient tenderneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Honour of our great Redeemer, as one undeſiled, and ſeparate from Sinners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out departing from this important Truth of his being made Sin for us; for the Holy Ghoſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms both this, and that he <hi>knew no Sin,</hi> in the ſame Breath, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> He was far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſonally conſcious of Sin, yet ſo far charg'd with it, as to be accountable in our ſtead for it. When the Scape-goat which had all the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People put upon his Head, was ſent away by the Hand of a ſit Man into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>He that let him go, was to waſh his Cloaths; and bath his Fleſh in Water, and afterwards to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the Camp,</hi> Lov. 16.26. And ſo the Prieſt was to do, after the ſprinkling of the Blood of the Heifer, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.7. <hi>And the man that burnt her,</hi> ver. 8. To ſignifie a reputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, though there was none really inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. One of the Ancients <hi>(Auguſtine)</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Words following the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. to Chriſt in this very Senſe; they were his Sins as he bore them, though he did not commit them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This ſerves to clear and vindicate the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in his ſevere dealing with Chriſt.</hi> His engaging to reſtore, made the Caſe the ſame, with reſpect to the Equity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Diſpenſation, as if he had taken away. He undertook as our Surety, and ſo the Debt was lookt upon as his own, though if you abſtract from the Conſideration, of his Suretiſhip, he owed nothing. As <hi>Judah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jacob,</hi> when
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41523:125"/>he intreated that his Brother <hi>Benjamin</hi> might be ſent with them to <hi>Egypt; I will be Surety for him, of my Hand ſhalt thou require him; if I bring him not to thee, let me bear the blame for ever,</hi> Gen. 43.9. So Chriſt undertook for the Sinner to God; at my Hand ſhalt thou require all that is due from him; let my Life go for his Life, let my Blood be taken in the Room of his, and accepted as a Ranſom for him. Now the Caſe being ſo, though God ſpared not his own Son, he was not unjuſtly rigorous. His Son acquits and juſtifies him in all that he inflicted on him; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22.1, 2, 3. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? why art thou ſo far from helping me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But thou art Holy.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> 17.25. He gives him the Title <hi>of righteous Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This ſhews the Reaſon of Chriſt's Silence, when he was upon his Trial, at the Bar of Men.</hi> Mark 15.3, 4, 5. <hi>The Chief Prieſts accuſed him of many Things, but he anſwered nothing. And Pilate asked him again, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Behold how many Things they witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee. But Jeſus yet anſwered nothing; ſo that Pilate marvelled.</hi> It was ſtrange and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing to him who knew not the Cauſe, and might well be ſo. There are various Reaſons aſſign'd for it, it was foretold <hi>that he ſhould be oppreſſed and afflicted, and yet be Dumb and not open his Mouth, like a Lamb brought to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Iſa. 53.7. He would do nothing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own Death, when his Hour was come; but I conceive the main Reaſon to be, that he ſtood in our Place, who were truly guilty, tho' he was Innocent; <hi>our Months were ſtopped,</hi> Rom. 3.19. And therefore he would not open his, as he could have done; our Cauſe was ſuch as could
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41523:126"/>not be pleaded, it was capable of no Defence; we had nothing to ſay, why Sentence ſhould not paſs upon us; and therefore he as repreſenting us, ſilently ſubmitted to Condemnation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This alſo intimates the Reaſon of the unſhaken Confidence of Chriſt in the worst part of all his Sufferings and Deſertions.</hi> He knew, that he had not perſonally deſerv'd them, and could not be always put to undergo them. If he had taken away, what he came to reſtore, it would have ſtruck a fearful damp upon his Spirit, when he enter'd into thoſe Clouds, and was drinking of the bitter Cup. Guilt breeds a great deal of Terror and Diffidence in the Mind, ſo that a Man knows not how to bear up under his Troubles, nor yet to expect an aeſcape out of them. But our Lord Jeſus having only the Chaſtiſement of our Peace upon him, and being to make Expiation for no faults but ours, had no Fears or Doubts to make him ſtagger; his Faith never faulter'd, but held on in the moſt vigorous Exerciſe to the very Laſt. He could boldly make thoſe challenges, which the Prophet does in writing of him, <hi>Who will contend with me? Let us stand together; who is my Adverſary? Let him come near to me,</hi> Iſa. 50.8. He knows what Grounds he ſuffer'd upon, and what would be the Iſſue of his Sufferings; that the Prince of the World had nothing in him, and Death could not have long Dominion over him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>If Christ hath made Restitution, then Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is unquestionably ſure.</hi> Sin hath been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Fleſh of Chriſt, therefore the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever muſt be certainly abſolved. God is as righteous now in forgiving, as he would have
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41523:126"/>been otherwiſe in puniſhing. He can do it now without any Impeachment of his Juſtice, Violation of his Truth, or Reflection on his Holineſs; yea all theſe Attributes ſway him to forgive; becauſe there is full Satisfaction made, all his Demands are anſwer'd, and he can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act no more; Payment is accepted, the Surety is diſcharg'd and taken from Priſon, and ſo your Indempnity infallibly obtain'd on the moſt honourable Terms. The Believer's Sins are therefore as ſurely blotted out, as the Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are written down. 'Tis obſerv'd by ſome, <hi>That the Trumpet of the Jubilee was order'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſound on the Day of Atonement, and then every Man had his Liberty, and return'd to his Poſſeſſion,</hi> Lev. 25.9, 10. So hath Chriſt by his atoning Sacrifice proclaim'd our Releaſe. The Scape-goat ſent into the Wilderneſs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came back; but (as ſome ſay) thrown off from a ſteep Rock, and notice given by blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Horns throughout the Land. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel gives the like comfortable Notice to us, that Chriſt hath abſolutely procur'd our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and Sin once pardon'd, ſhall never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd againſt us.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let none reſt contented without Chriſt.</hi> They that can be ſatisfied in the want of him, never conſider what he came about, and of what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment that is. When God calls for his Dues, and proceeds in a legal Manner againſt you (as he will do, <hi>for you are under the I aw, if not under Grace</hi>) How will you render them to him? Or where will you borrow? Who can lend you ſo vaſt a ſumm, as is requifite to be
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41523:127"/>laid down? Whither can you fly for help, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove or below, in Heaven or Earth. To which of the Saints will you turn? Who among them all can by any means redeem his Brother? They will tell you, that they have not enough for themſelves, they muſt have periſht without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from Chriſt, as well as you, what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reckoning will it be, when the Books are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, the whole ſcore caſt up, and all your Arrears ſtrictly enquir'd into? When inſtead of appeaſing God by ſufficient Reſtitution, you muſt look to be repaid by him with implacable Fury? Bethink your ſelves of your Condition, all you that are far from Righteouſneſs: Think what it is, <hi>For your Iniquities to be before the Lord continually,</hi> Pſalm 109.15. Whereas by coming to Chriſt, <hi>They would be all removed in one Day,</hi> Zech. 3.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Take heed of detracting from Chriſt, who does ſo much for you.</hi> He that repairs all our Loſſes for us, will not give the Glory of it to us, and woe be to us, if we aſſume the leaſt Part of that Glory to our ſelves. 'Tis Honour enough to us to be free Receivers, but 'tis a diſparagement to Chriſt, if we preſume in any Reſpect to be rightful Purchaſers. This is to commit a piece of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Theft, to add to all our other Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences. When God hath <hi>raiſed up ſuch an Horn of Salvation for us,</hi> Luke 1.69. Shall we ſay, <hi>That we have taken to us Horns by our own Strength?</hi> Amos 6.13. Is the Iniquity of our heels too little for us, that we muſt back it with ſuch Pride of Heart? Hath the Work of Faith any Vertue or Power in it ſelf to juſtifie, or is it the Dignity of the Object, that Faith lays hold upon? Does our New Obedience
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41523:127"/>make any recompence to God for our Old Sins? Does any Man in the common Affairs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life imagine to clear himſelf from form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Debts, by paying thoſe of a later Date? is our Repentance any Reparation for our Offence? That's the Duty of a ſinful Creature, without the help of any new (ſuppos'd) Law to make it ſo; Light of Nature teaches, that 'tis a Sin to detain what hath been wrongfully taken, <hi>Job</hi> 20.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let all that have Chriſt, be excited to Glory in him.</hi> 'Tis that which they not only may, but ought to do, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. <hi>ult.</hi> The humbling ſight of Sin ſhould not hinder or leſſen our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rejoycing in his Salvation. It becometh every one that believeth in Jeſus, to lift up his Face without Fear, and without Confuſion; Chriſt hath Pray'd againſt it; <hi>ver.</hi> 6. of this Pſalm, <hi>Let not them that wait on Thee oh Lord, be aſham'd for my ſake,</hi> &amp;c. If there be any Cauſe of ſhame remaining to a Believer (as a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) Chriſts Work muſt be imperfect, and the reproach will lye at his Door. 'Tis a part of our gratitude to Chriſt to commend him to the World, <hi>as one mighty to ſave.</hi> Thus <hi>he is daily to be praiſed,</hi> Pſalm 72.15. As he did not hide God's Righteouſneſs within his Heart, ſo neither muſt we, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 10.10. Our Tongues are to Publiſh his Righteouſneſs, and make ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>mention of it,</hi> Pſalm 71.16. It is not more our Priviledge to be inveſted with it, than 'tis our Duty to confeſs it, and to take all fit occaſions of magnifying him for it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Remember your increaſed Obligations of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjection to Chriſt.</hi> It would be vilely diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous; and inexcuſably Preſumptuous to take
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41523:128"/>encouragement from this Doctrine to run up new ſcores. They that can be guilty of ſuch ill behaviour towards Chriſt, and wax ſo wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton againſt him, ſhew plainly, that they have no real Part in him. <hi>He that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his;</hi> Rom. 8.9. And does this kind of Carriage diſcover any Thing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt? No ſurely, but on the contrary, the Spirit of the Devil, who would ſtain the Glory of our Holy Redeemer, by ſetting him forth as the Miniſter of Sin. God will not bear ſuch abominable ſilth upon the Foundation of his laying; even a Man would not ſuffer his Kindneſs to be ſo perverted and abus'd, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his juſt Reſentment of it. If we Sin through weakneſs, we have an Advocate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but if we Sin wilfully, there is no more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to be offer'd; confident Debtors that Care not how they Live, nor what they ſpend, are not to be countenanc'd; thoſe Bankrupts whom Chriſt hath once reinſtated, are made very Cautious afterwards.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Learn not to Repine at any of your deſerved Chaſtenings.</hi> Straggling Sheep can have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain, when they paſs under the Rod, conſidering how the good Shepherd was ſmitten. How can ſuch dry Trees as we are fly in God's Face, when he is hewing of us with gentle ſtrokes, if we did but bear upon our Minds, how the Green-Tree was cloven in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der! Know thou that God <hi>exacteſt of thee leſs than thine Iniquity deſerveth,</hi> Job 10.6. Thy Afflictions are moderate, and God deals with thee in Mercy, rather than in Judgment; and thou haſt need of theſe Things to bridle or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim thee, but our Lord Jeſus was more rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:41523:128"/>handled, who was worthy of the higheſt Expreſſions of Love, and never could be caſt out of the Boſom of the Father. Chriſt was not indebted to the Juſtice of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Typiſied by an Heifer <hi>upon which no Yoke ever came,</hi> Numb. 19.2. And yet how was he proſecuted at the ſuit of Heaven it ſelf! There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God deals ſo favourably with us real Offenders (as he does indeed at the worſt, if we compare our Sufferings with Chriſt's) we ſhould lay our Hand upon our Mouths, and calmly bear his reſtrained Indignation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Follow the ſteps of Chriſt, by being meek and patient as he was, under the ſharpeſt Exerciſes from cauſeleſs Enemies.</hi> The having of Truth and Juſtice on our ſide will not warrant unruly Clamour and Contention. 'Tis much better in many Caſes for a Man to give up his own Right, than to behave himſelf unſeemly in the Defence of it, ſo as utterly to break the Bond of Peace, and ſtain the Credit of his Chriſtian Profeſſion. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemn'd for going to Law before the Unbelievers, for the ſmalleſt Matters; and the Apoſtle puts it to them; <hi>Why do you not rather take wrong, and ſuffer your ſelves to be defrauded?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.7. 'Tis one of the glories of Chriſt's Diſciples to lye down with quietneſs under the worſt of Injuries from unreaſonable Men, when they cannot regularly help them, <hi>i. e.</hi> without Sin and Scandal. In the Caſe of our good Name (which is more valuable than great Riches) when Things are laid to our Charge which we know not, there ought to be an aſſerting of our Innocence indeed, but yet a bearing of Reproach; we ſhould diſown the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41523:129"/>guilt, and yet ſubmit to the diſhonour. Thus <hi>Job would not remove his Integrity, nor let go his Righteouſneſs</hi> (Chap. 27.5, 6.) and yet ſays, <hi>That if his Adverſary had written a Book, he would take it on his Shoulder, and bind it as a Crown to him,</hi> Chap. 31.35, 36. This is to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Temper and Practiſe of our Bleſſed Lord, who readily <hi>restor'd what he took not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>

               <p>THE main deſign of this Epiſtle is to obviate the dangerous inſinuations of the falſe Teachers, who had crept into the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and vehemently urged Circumciſion, and the keeping of the Law, as neceſſary to Mens Juſtification and Salvation. The beginning of this Chapter is particularly levelled againſt this Principle; for here the Apoſtle ſhews that the aboliſhed Ceremonies of the former Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were properly ſuited to their minority and infant State, which required Inſtruction in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Myſteries by carnal Reſemblances, but that now Chriſt by his actual appearance in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Fleſh, had obtain'd our Freedom from all thoſe Yokes, and put us into a fuller poſſeſſion of the Rights of Children, even of ſuch as are come to Age, and grown up to riper Years. This is the point which he is purſuing in the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41523:130"/>Text; <hi>And becauſe you are Sons,</hi> &amp;c. or to prove that you are Sons, and dealt with accordingly.</p>
               <p>In which words we have ſomething premiſed, and laid as a Foundation, and ſome things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as the Effects and Conſequences of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Something premiſed and laid as a Foundation, [Becauſe you are Sons.]</hi> Here the Adoption of Believers is poſitively aſſerted, as a thing in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion. There are indeed ſome further Fruits of our Adoption, yet future and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo the Redemption of our Bodies from the Grave at the end of the World, is ſtiled the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption which we wait for, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8.23. becauſe the Reſurrection to Glory will be an eminent declaration of our Adoption, as Chriſt was <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the ſon of God with power, by his riſing from the dead,</hi> chap. 1.4. but ſtill our Adoption it ſelf is not deferr'd till then; the Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the contrary, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>Beloved, now we are the ſons of God.</hi> So in this Epiſtle, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.26. <hi>You are all the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> As ſoon as we come home to God by believing, we are taken into this Relation; for the Houſhold of Faith is his ſelect peculiar Family.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Some things propoſed as the Effects and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this;</hi> partly with reference to the Act of God the Father, and partly with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Act of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As to what concerns the Act of the Father, who is plainly meant in that Clauſe; [God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts.]</hi> Here we may conſider the Perſon ſpoken of, the act reſpecting this Perſon, and the Objects that have the benefit of this Act.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:41523:130"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Perſon ſpoken of; The Spirit of his Son; i. e.</hi> the Spirit of Chriſt. So he is call'd <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. This Character is given him on this occaſion for various reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt. Becauſe 'tis the ſame Spirit which was in Chriſt, and which is in all Believers.</hi> That one Spirit which abode upon him, reſteth upon them alſo. Though he had a greater Fullneſs of the Spirit, yet they in their meaſure are filled with him too.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly. By the effectual Operation of this Spirit, Chriſt is formed in us, and we conformed to him.</hi> He faſhions the whole Church of the Firſt-born into the lively Similitude of God's only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly. To intimate Christ's procurement of this Bleſſing for us. We were predeſtinated to the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children by Christ,</hi> Epheſ. 1.5. Election is attributed to the Father, but the Son is the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of what we are elected to. Hence he is ſaid to <hi>give power</hi> (or right) <hi>to become the Sons of God to them that receive him,</hi> John 1.12. and 'tis by virtue of our union to him that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our loſt relation to God; all the Children of God are given to Chriſt, written in his Book, and ranſom'd by his Blood; for he redeem'd us, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. of this Chapter.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly, To teach us, that the Spirit it ſelf is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for us by Christ.</hi> They that have not the Spirit, are ſuch as have not the Son; for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the one, does infallibly carry along with it a participation of the other. Thoſe Rivers of living Water, by which the effuſion of the Spirit is expreſs'd, flow out of his pierc'd ſide: The Holy Ghoſt had never been ſent down
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41523:131"/>from Heaven, if the Son of God had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecended firſt to prepare his way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Act reſpecting this Perſon. God hath ſent forth.</hi> The ſame word is uſed with reſpect to the Son, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. this act is aſcribed to God ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.30. <hi>John</hi> 14.26. and it imports not any change of place, as if he were more diſtant from the Father when he is thus ſent, than he was before (for he is Omnipreſent, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.7. and of the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided Eſſence with the Father) but it notes only his Commiſſion for ſome ſpecial Work in and upon the Creature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Objects that have the Benefit of this Act; Into your Hearts; i. e.</hi> into the Hearts of them that believe. Two things are ſignified by this;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Work here intended, is an inward Work:</hi> Ezek. 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within them.</hi> And therefore 'tis ſecret, and does not miniſter to Vain-glory, or carnal Boaſting. The Teſtimony of the Spirit is privately given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us; and the new Name is that which no Man knows, but the receiver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis a ſaving Work.</hi> The Reſidence of the Spirit is appointed not in the Brain, by common unſanctified Gifts, ſuch as Hypocrites may be endowed with, but in the Heart, where all the Habits of Grace are planted, and from whence all the Iſſues of Life proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly. As to what concerns the Act of the Spirit, [Crying, Abba, Father.]</hi> Here we may examine how the Spirit is ſaid to <hi>cry</hi> in our Hearts, and what it is which he does <hi>cry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How is the Spirit ſaid to</hi> cry <hi>in our Hearts, when he is ſent forth into them? Anſ.</hi> Even as
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:41523:131"/>God is ſaid to know, when he makes others know; <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3. So <hi>the Spirit maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8.26. in helping us to Pray for our ſelves; and therefore 'tis a vain and feeble Argument which ſome <hi>Socinians</hi> would bring from this and the like Texts againſt the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt. Matth. 10.20. <hi>It is not you that ſpeak, but the ſpirit of the Father that ſpeaketh in you: i. e.</hi> Though your Tongues utter words, yet they could not do it without his aſſiſtance and direction, as the principal neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Cauſe; As in this Epiſtle, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle corrects himſelf, not as if he were not the true and proper Subject of ſpiritual Life, but to ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt was the Spring and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it. So here the Spirit ſent forth into our Hearts is ſaid to <hi>Cry,</hi> becauſe they cry through his gracious Influence. The Holy Ghoſt teaches us to pray, but ſtrictly it is we that pray in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Jude</hi> 20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What is it which the Spirit does cry? Abba, Father; i. e.</hi> Father, Father. This Repetition may be upon two accounts,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To intimate that both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles <hi>are equal ſharers in this Bleſſing of Adoption;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle makes uſe of two Words in two different Tongues to expreſs the ſame thing. <hi>Abba</hi> being a Syriack word, which was a Language then commonly known among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that which we render Father, beinga <hi>Greek</hi> word, which was a Language then commonly uſed among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Though a Learned Critick <hi>(Capellus Spicileg.)</hi> hath taken much pains to prove that <hi>Abba</hi> is a <hi>Greek</hi> word alſo, and ſo applied by the Apoſtle in this place, alluding to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41523:132"/>the manner of little Children, when they firſt begin to ſpeak and call after their Parents, which in all Languages, as well as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> isn ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the ſame ſound with this word, <hi>Abba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To note the ſtrength and vehemency of deſire.</hi> The doubling of words does frequently ſignify this in Scripture. Our Lord, in the Garden, when <hi>he offered up prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong crys and tears,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7.) makes uſe of thoſe very words, ſo repeated, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.36. <hi>Abba, Father, take away this cup from me.</hi> So on the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.</hi> So when <hi>Elijah</hi> was caught up, <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaw it, and cry'd, <hi>My Father, my Father, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.12. And the fooliſh virgins that came when the Door was ſhut, cry'd, <hi>Lord, Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 25.11. All which Paſſages ſpeak a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and extraordinary con cernment of Soul.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral things which may be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from hence, which I ſhall but mention, tho' ſeaſonable enough in an Age ſo much corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the revival and induſtrious Propagation of old Errors.</p>
               <p>As, 1. <hi>That there are Three Sacred Perſons in the Bleſſed Godhead, the Father, Son, and Spirit;</hi> all of them held forth to us at one view, in the compaſs of this ſingle Verſe, yea in that ſingle Clauſe, <hi>God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Spirit is not a Quality, or Operation, but a Perſon that hath a true and real ſubſiſtence of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> elſe this Phraſe of <hi>being ſent forth,</hi> could not agree to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This Spirit proceeds both from Father and Son;</hi> for he is ſent by the Father, and he is the Spirit of the Son. There is an Order among the Divine Perſons, though no priority of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:41523:132"/>and according to that Order there is an ineffable myſterious communication from the Firſt and Second Perſon to the Third. But the chief thing is this:</p>
               <p>Obſ. <hi>The great Goſpel Privilege of a Believer's Sonſhip is not only diſcern'd, but improv'd by the help of the Spirit of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, I. Shew that a Believer's Sonſhip is a great Privilege.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>II. That it is a Goſpel Privilege.</item>
                  <item>III. How this is diſcern'd by the help of the Spirit.</item>
                  <item>IV. How improved by his help.</item>
                  <item>V. Uſe.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>To ſhew, That a Believer's Sonſhip is a great Privilege.</hi> This will appear in ſix things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis a Privilege of God's everlaſting Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which is more durable, and therefore more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than Life it ſelf.</hi> The Favour of God is never wholly withdrawn from thoſe that are once his Children by Adoption. Goodneſs ſhall furely follow them all their Days, and continue towards them to Eternity. Earthly Parents may abandon, and be alienated from their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Off-ſpring, but God will not, yea cannot forget them. <hi>A Son abides in the Houſe always, John</hi> 8.35. he ſhall not be diſinherited, nor turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of doors, nor the entail of Covenant Bleſſings be cut off from him. He is brought into a Relation which ſhall not be deſtroyed, and dignified with a Name which ſhall never be blotted out. If God is pleaſed to Adopt us, 'tis certain that he hath loved us from the beginning, and will to the end.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:41523:133"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'tis inſeparably attended with regenerating Grace.</hi> Both theſe Privileges of Adoption and Regeneration, do conſtantly go hand in hand. There is a real and a relative change togehter. As the Fathers of our Fleſh communicate not only their Names, but Natures to us, ſo here is a new Birth, as well as a new Title. When God calls us into this honourable State, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets us of his own Will; and at the ſame time that we contract ſuch an Alliance to him, we are alſo born of him, <hi>John</hi> 1.13. It would be a far leſs Privilege to be a Child of God, if there were not a Divine renewing in the Spirit of our minds connected with it. To remain upon the dead ſtock of the old <hi>Adam</hi> ſtill, is a miſerable Curſe which would mar the Bleſſing; but thanks be to God it is not ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Sons of God are under the Exerciſe of ſparing mercy.</hi> There is a ſweetneſs in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of Father, which agrees to the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in dealing with his Children, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>I will ſpare them as a Man ſpareth his own Son that ſerveth him.</hi> He does not mark their Iniquities, nor revenge them as he might. He does not reckon with them for every Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, nor rebuke them for any in hot diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. He does not ſtrike them with an Arm like God, but chaſtens them with the Rod of Men. His free Compaſſion overcomes his deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Severity; he would be juſt in doing, what, out of indulgent pity, he leaves undone. How many wandrings of theirs does he paſs over? what abatements does he make, when ſin is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited upon them? and how gently doth he lift them up, after he hath caſt them down?</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:41523:133"/>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>They are Objects of a peculiar Providence;</hi> both in reſpect of Care, by preſerving them from Ill, and, in reſpect of Bounty, by ſupplying them with Good.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of Care, by preſerving them from Evil. His Children have a place of Refuge,</hi> Prov. 14.26. ſuch an one as others have not. They whom God takes as his own, are received into his Almighty Protection, which the reſt of the World can have little ground to hope for. To ſuch the Promne belongs, and to ſuch only; <hi>He ſhall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings ſhalt thou truſt,</hi> Pſal. 91.4. what a Charge did <hi>David</hi> give to all his Officers concerning his Son, (though at that time in Rebellion) <hi>Beware that none touch the young man Abſalom,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.12. God is more ſolicitous for the ſafety of all his, and therefore he is ſaid to carry them in his Boſom, where nothing truly hurtful can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect of Bounty, by ſupplying them with Good, even all that is neceſſary and convenient for them.</hi> Whoever want, his Children ſhall not; he knows what they need, and when they need it, and always deviſeth means for their ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Relief. He calls Heaven and Earth to take notice of this; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.2. <hi>I have nouriſh'd and brought up Children.</hi> There is a Table prepar'd for the King's Sons, at which his <hi>Mephiboſheths</hi> eat, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.11. God hath eminently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for their certain and undoubted mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; there is an Emphaſis upon it; <hi>Verily thou ſhalt be fed,</hi> Pſal. 37.3. rather than not have a Seed to ſerve him, he'll raiſe Children out of Stones; rather than they ſtarve, thoſe Stones ſhall become Bread.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:41523:134"/>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>They are made joint Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> which is extraordinary indeed, and yet follows upon our being Children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. No Children of God, but what is entituled to a glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and (which makes it much more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous) they are made to inherit with our Lord Jeſus himſelf. God <hi>calls them into the Fellowſhip of his Son,</hi> 1 cor. 1.9. to partake of the ſame Glory which is given to him, to poſſeſs the ſame Kingdom which is appointed to him, to ſit upon his Throne, and reign in Company with the Lamb for ever and ever. As if it were not enough for us to reap the Benefits of the Sufferings of Chriſt, we ſhall ſhare in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement: the depth of his Humiliation was purely for our ſakes, the height of his Exaltation will likewiſe turn to our account.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>They have the beſt and most uſeful Service from all Creatures, in the inviſible and viſible World, both thoſe that are above them, and thoſe that are below them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Creatures that are above them do Service to them.</hi> Angels diſdain not to be their Guardians while they are here, as they are to be their more intimate and perpetual Aſſociates here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>Are they not all</hi> (without exception, the higheſt Orders of them) <hi>ſent forth as miniſtring Spirits, on the behalf of the Heirs of Salvation? Heb.</hi> 1. ult. Who but they can look to be thus attended? Angels of Light do gladly miniſter to the Children of Light; they are deputed by our Heavenly Father to keep us in all our ways, and at laſt to convey us home.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Creatures below them, are directed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled to ſerve them alſo.</hi> Every one in God's great Houſe on Earth, ſhall (though perhaps
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41523:134"/>without your knowledge, and againſt your will) promote the Intereſt of thoſe that are deſign'd to dwell in Heaven. As <hi>all things are put under the feet of Christ, our elder Brother,</hi> Epheſ. 1.22. ſo we by him recover as much of our loſt Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as we have real occaſion for. The whole Creation is more ſubject to the Heirs of God, than to the common Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To ſhew that this Sonſhip of Believers is a Goſpel Privilege.</hi> It is ſo in a two-fold ſenſe, by way of oppoſition to the Law of Works, and by way of compoſition with the times of the Old Teſtament. Conſider it either way, it is truely and ſtrictly Evangelical.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In Oppoſition to the Law of Works.</hi> No Soul was ever inveſted thereby with this bleſſed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Adoption. This is plain, becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Law worketh Wrath,</hi> and nothing elſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. It ſpeaks no Favour to any Son or Daughter of <hi>Adam;</hi> it breaths out Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but is utterly ſilent, as to Promiſes. The Language of the Law is Judgment without Mercy, extremity of Vengeance without any mixture of Kindneſs. Therefore 'tis ſaid, that <hi>as many as are under the Works of the Law</hi> (who are in the firſt Covenant, and adhere to it, and reſt upon it) <hi>are under the Curſe,</hi> (who are in the firſt Covenant, and adhere to it, and reſt upon it) <hi>are under the Curſe,</hi> Gal. 3.10. Adoption through Grace, is perfectly concluded by the Law; it will never make Men Children of God, but pronounces them Children of Wrath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Law convinces of Sin and Guilt, but gives no Righteouſneſs; therefore Sonſhip cannot come by the Law.</hi> For Adoption preſuppoſes Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is conſequent upon it. The Children
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41523:135"/>of God are all Righteous, with a Righteouſneſs that perfectly anſwers the Legal Demands, <hi>viz.</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>For in him ſhall all the Seed of Iſrael be juſtified,</hi> Iſa. 45.25. But now all the natural Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> before they are adopted to God, are Condemned for want of ſuch a Righteouſneſs. The Law Sentence goes forth againſt them, and takes hold of them, as Guilty Sinners, that have broken the Commandment, can never keep it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>in compariſon with the Times of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 'Tis true, the Believers in thoſe times were the Sons and Daughters of God, and they challeng'd their Privilege; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Doubtleſs, thou art our Father,</hi> but yet it was in ſo defective a degree, that they ſeem'd more like to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants than Sons, and were trained up under ſuitable Diſcipline. Hence the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. following the Text, <hi>Wherefore thou art no more a Servant, but a Son;</hi> implying, that thou haſt been in a kind of ſervile, but art now Tranſlated, in theſe New Teſtament Times, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more filial, State. Our Privilege of Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, under the Goſpel, excels in Two Regards,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As to clearneſs of Manifeſtation and Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> The Children of Princes and great Perſons many times know little of the Honour and Hopes which they are born to, till they arrive at ſome competent maturity: So the Ancient Believers underſtood a great deal leſs of Divine Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by Jeſus Chriſt, than we do now. They (like <hi>Moſes</hi>) had a Veil upon their Faces, we behold with open Face, if compared with them. They were not ſtrangers to the Covenant of Promiſe, but their acquaintance with the things promiſed fell very ſhort of ours. All that is
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41523:135"/>freely given us of God, is now made more known, and plac'd in a better Light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As to Fulneſs and Amplitude of Enjoyment.</hi> The Merit and Influence of Chriſt's Death in all Points extended backwards, as far as the Firſt Ages of the World, wherein any Believers li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but the Fruits of it then did not ſo abound, as ſince his coming. The Spirit was ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and pour'd out then, but not ſo richly and liberally as now. He was given then more ſparingly, now in a larger meaſure. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently their Fruition of this bleſſed Sonſhip was not equal to ours; though they had ſuch a Privilege, they could not uſe it with ſo much advantage. They were like Heirs in Childhood, that have only ſome ſmaller allowance during that time; we are like thoſe upon the edge of Manhood, who have more of their Eſtate in their own Hands.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>How is this Goſpel-Privilege diſcern'd by the help of the Spirit?</hi> How do we come to know that we have it, through the ſending of him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ours Hearts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In ſix Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Spirit of God in his dealing with Souls, does not ordinarily begin as a Spirit of Adoption, but rather as a Spirit of Bondage.</hi> This ſeems to be hinted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>You have not received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> This was written to actual Believers, thoſe that were called to be Saints; and their not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Spirit of Bondage again, after they had received the Spirit of Adoption, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes they had ſo received him before. The Spirit of Bondage and Adoption, are one and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41523:136"/>the ſame Spirit, diſtinguiſh'd only by various O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, noting two different Effects of the ſame Cauſe. Now uſually the former of theſe does precede and introduce the latter; while the Spirit is making uſe of the Law to bring us to Chriſt, we ſee our ſelves in a miſerable undone Condition, when he hath fully brought us to Chriſt by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, the Scene is alter'd, and we perceive our ſelves to be the Seed which the Lord hath Bleſſed. Strong Cordials are not ſo fit to be immediately pour'd into foul Stomachs: There is a ſhaking which goes before the Eſtabliſhment; a making of Trouble before the ſpeaking of Peace; a Storm raiſed in the Soul before a comfortable Calm: As <hi>Manaſſeh was taken first among the Thorns, and bound in Fetters, and carried to Babylon, and then knew the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 33.11, 13. And as <hi>Joſeph was ſold for a Servant into Egypt, and laid in Irons there,</hi> which made way for his Enlargement and Preferment, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 105.17, 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo does our Exerciſe under a Spirit of Bondage tend to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by the Spirit of Adoption, if we are the Called according to God's purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The time of our continuance under a Spirit of Bondage, before we receive the Spirit of Adoption, with the degrees and meaſures of its working, is very different and uncertain.</hi> Some know more of the Terrors of the Lord than others, and ſome are held longer in Priſon before they are brought out; though no Soul knows more, or is held longer, than God ſees needful to its thorough Humiliation. We muſt be laid low, and yet we ſhall not be quite ſunk. God's wounding and healing of our Spirits is not always performed with the ſame ſpeed; as all Convictions are not
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:41523:136"/>alike ſharp. God does not limit himſelf in this caſe to any ſtated Rules which are known to us, but acts as he thinks fit, towards various Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. He hath ſaid <hi>he will not contend for ever,</hi> but yet we cannot punctually tell how long he will contend. His dealing with one Soul muſt not be alledged as the exact Pattern of his Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with another. Some Diſpoſitions are more rough and ſtubborn, ſome ſins have been more hainouſly aggravated; perhaps their Chains may be the heavier, and not ſo ſoon taken off. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Parents conſider the Tempers and Crimes of their ſeveral Children, and proportion their Rebukes accordingly.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>THE Spirits uſual way of evidencing our Sonſhip to us, is nbot by any vocal Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or immediate Revelation.</hi> Every Servant muſt not look to be as his Lord in this reſpect, who had the Spirit of God viſibly deſcending upon him at his Baptiſm, <hi>with a voice from Heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 3.16, 17. What ſudden Divine Suggeſtions to this purpoſe, filling the Soul in a moment with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Joy, may be ſometimes afforded to ſome peculiar Perſons at peculiar ſeaſons, I will not diſpute; it may be, when a Soul is under ſtrong and violent Temptations from Satan, to throw up all its hopes; or after long Attendance upon God in ſome ſoleme ſecret Duties, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Entrance upon ſome very difficult and hazardous publick Services; but ſuch things are not commonly to be expected. God does not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41523:137"/>tie or confine himſelf to ordinary means, but yet he generally makes uſe of them, and works by them. 'Tis poſſible <hi>ſome may be wone without the Word,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.1. but yet the <hi>most are born again by the Word,</hi> chap. 1.23. ſo 'tis poſſible, that the Spirit may in ſome caſes reveal himſelf to our Comfort without the Word (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt it) but this is not the Method which he commonly takes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The uſual way of the Spirit in the declaring and confirming of our Sonſhip to us, is by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular powerful Application of Goſpel Promiſes to us, and an illuſtration of his own Fruits in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By an Application of Goſpel Promiſes.</hi> There are many Promiſes to the ſame Effect with that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. <hi>I will be a Father to you, and you ſhall be my Sons and Daughters,</hi> &amp;c. This avails but little to us, till by a Spirit of Faith we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to take hold of it; 'tis great and precious in it ſelf, but we are not at all the richer, till it is applied and ſet home with a mighty power upon the Soul; then 'tis an ineſtimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, a Mine, a Spring of everlaſting Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Spirit takes of Chriſt's, and ſhews them unto us; not only Chriſt's things, but Chriſt's words too; and that word among the reſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.8. <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſs,</hi> Gr. Orphans. Such a word as this is enough, if he do but imprint it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By an illuſtration of his own Fruits.</hi> Theſe are the Marks of our Adoption which the Word refers us to, and ſo the Spirit ſpeaks according to the Word, in helping us to argue from them. As the Grace of God in Truth, is by his Operation, ſo the diſcovery of the Truth of Grace, is by his Light reflected upon it; that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:41523:138"/>Chriſt formed in the Soul may be even felt, as when the Babe leaped in <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Womb, at <hi>Mary</hi>'s Salutation, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.44. The Spirit of God ſubmits his witneſſing Act to be tried by what he hath wrought in us, which is no more diſhonour to him, than it was to Chriſt, who requir'd the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>believe him for his Works ſakes, John</hi> 14.11. As <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons pointed him to the Waggons which <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent, for a proof that he was alive, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.27.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Spirit of God is very Arbitrary, both in the giving and continuing of his Divine Teſtimony.</hi> He is an infinitely free Agent as to both; He ſhines as well as breaths upon whom he pleaſes, and when he pleaſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Spirit acts Arbitrarily, after a Sovereign way, in the giving of this Teſtimony concerning our Adoption.</hi> The Liberty of the Divine Will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Communication of Grace, and yet more in the diſpenſing of Comfort. The Spirit of God is not at our command, any more than the Wind which Chriſt compaes him to, and which God is ſaid to <hi>gather in his Fiſts,</hi> Prov. 33.4. and to <hi>bring forth out of his Treaſure,</hi> Jer. 10.13. He is not ſuch a Witneſs as Men may ſummon and produce to clear and ſtrengthen their Cauſe in Humane Courts, who ſometimes are oblig'd under certain Penalties to appear and give in their Evidence. There can be no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity laid upon him; as God ſometimes holdsl his peace and is ſtill, when he might anſwer by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things, ſo the Spirit of God might be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in our Hearts, when he cryes, <hi>Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:41523:138"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Spirit Acts after the ſame Arbitrary manner in the continuing of this Teſtimony, after 'tis once given.</hi> He can weaken and abate it, he can ſuſpend and with-draw it, at his own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. He that bears Witneſs at one Time, may not do it at another. Evidences may be darken'd and obſcur'd, which were very bright and plain; hidden Manna, like that in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, is not conſtantly gather'd every Day; but very often is like that Veſſel, in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Viſion, which was let down thrice to the Earth, <hi>And then received up again into Heaven,</hi> Acts 10.16. This makes the Ebbings and Flowings in our Hopes and Joys.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Spirits teſtifying of our Adoption is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſtinct from our Adoption it ſelf, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly Eſſential to it.</hi> The Truth of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation does neither include, nor depend upon our Knowledge of that Relation. A Man may be really <hi>a Child of God,</hi> and not know himſelf to be ſo by the infallible Declaration of the Spirit of God; he may have (as <hi>Job</hi> had, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.19) <hi>A Witneſs in Heaven, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord on high,</hi> and yet want a legible Copy of it in his own Boſom for his preſent Satisfaction. The Spirits witneſſing is not that which makes us the <hi>Children of God,</hi> but ſuppoſes us to be ſo before; he Witneſſes <hi>that we are Children,</hi> and therefore we are not the leſs Children, though he ſhould not Witneſs it. We ſhould loſe the Comfort of our Sonſhip very much indeed, but the fundamental Priviledge it ſelf would remain however. Things which for a while are not perceiv'd to be, do not therefore ceaſe to be; we may be taken into <hi>the number of the Sons of God,</hi> and yet want the Manifeſtation of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:41523:139"/>ſuch (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19.) I ſpeak not this to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any in the leaſt from looking after the clearing up of theſe Matters as much as can be to their own Souls, but to prevent thoſe from being too much diſcouraged, who are yet kept in the dark by God; that they may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude poſitively againſt themſelves, but rather take Courage with the Church under the hidings of God's Face; <hi>But thou art our Father,</hi> Iſa. 64.7, 8.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>How is this Priviledge of a Believer's Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip improve'd by the Spirit's help?</hi> The Text ſeems to have a ſpecial Reference to Prayer, and to our Challenging and Pleading of this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial Relation in that Duty. I ſhall endeavour the opening of this Point in theſe eight Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Spirit of Chriſt is particularly promis'd and given as a Spirit of Supplication,</hi> Zech. 12.10. His Influence is eminently needful in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. We ſhould never ſind in our Hearts to Pray one acceptable Prayer to God throughout our Lives, if the Spirit did not put it into our Hearts firſt. We cannot ſpeak to God in any Language which he will hear, upon any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever, without the Spirits Direction. They are all vain Words, which are not of his Teaching; the froth and ſcum of Man's Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which however eſteemed among Creatures here below, bears no Price at all in Heaven. Every Petition which the Father receives, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated and drawn up by the Holy Ghoſt. God never inclines his own Ear, but when he thus prepares our Hearts: Except this Advocate be at Work in us, there is no finding of Audience
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:41523:139"/>with him. And therefore they that prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce all Supplication in and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (as ſome have done) may as well go a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further, and lay aſide all Supplication in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; for whatever Prayer they pour out, is as Water ſpilt on the Ground.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Effectual Prayer, ſuch as the Spirit teaches and helps us in, is put up to God as a Father.</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is a Pattern to us; and if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſtyle of his Prayers, we ſhall find, that they are all grounded upon this Relation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. <hi>I thank thee, oh Father,</hi> &amp;c. which Title is repeated, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Even ſo Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 12.27. <hi>Father, ſave me from this Hour. Father, glorifie thy Name.</hi> And no leſs than ſix Times over, <hi>Chap</hi> 17. Again in the Garden, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, ſome of his laſt Words upon the Croſs were in the ſame ſtrain, when he came to give up the Ghoſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.46. <hi>Father into thy Hands,</hi> &amp;c. And that we might not think, this was proper and ſuitable to him only, the Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he gave to his Diſciples, is ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: <hi>After this manner Pray ye, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. When the Scripture ſpeaks of making <hi>Supplication to our Judge,</hi> Job 9.15. We muſt underſtand it of Praying that he would not deal with us as a Judge, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 143.2. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into Judgment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Praying Diſpoſitions of Children are firſt infus'd into them by the Spirit.</hi> Every Babe in Chriſt is furniſh'd with them, and as he increaſes in ſpiritual Strength and Stature, they grow up with him. Children naturally apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Parents for what they want, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to other Perſons; and this alſo is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:41523:140"/>to all the Children of God. 'Tis a part of their new Nature, which is the Work and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Spirit. He that hath not a Divine Principle in him, which leads him to call on the Father, deſerves not to be call'd a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Aſſoon as the Soul is born again, it crys, and its cry is immediately to him whom it is born of. This cry is renewed every Day, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times in a Day; for there is an Habit of this kind emplanted in the Soul, which puts forth it ſelf in frequent Acts. The Spirit's quickening is always accompanied with inward groaning; ſo that, where no ſuch groans are, we may be ſure that Death hath Dominion ſtill, and the Man hath not begun to Live.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Spirit fills the Mouth with Arguments in the very Act of Prayer, ſuch as are fit to be us'd and urg'd to a Father.</hi> Holy and humble Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations with God, are truly the very ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of Prayer, wherein its great Strength lies. It does not ſo much conſiſt in the bare propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our Requeſts to God, as in the alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of proper Pleas for God's anſwering and fulfilling of them. Such as that of the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15. <hi>Where is the ſounding of thy Bowels, and of thy Mercies towards me? are they reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> This is Connected with their. Claim of God as a Father in the next Words twice, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. A fatherly Relation ſpeaks Tenderneſs and Compaſſion, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.13. <hi>Like as a Fasther pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth his Children,</hi> &amp;c. Whoever are void of Pity, Fathers are wont to put on Bowels; or if the Fathers of our Fleſh ſhould be unnatural, the Father of our Spirits cannot be ſo; and therefore this was a very apt and agreeable Plea, which the Spirit of God hath Regiſter'd
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:41523:140"/>for us. Whatever you need to have done, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of God to do, as becomes a Father.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Spirit enables us to go to God as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with Confidence; for whom can Children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair ſo freely to, as to their own Parent?</hi> Whom can they with ſo much certainty expect Relief from, as from him that begat them? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>we have Acceſs by one Spirit unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Eph. 2.18. So we are ſaid <hi>to have boldneſs and acceſs; or acceſs with boldneſs,</hi> Chap. 3.12. The Command of God is to ask in Faith; to truſt him and depend upon him for the ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Accompliſhment of all our regular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; and this dependance is as much our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as Subjection is; and it is every whit as difficult, yea as impoſſible to be perform'd, without the help of the Spirit. 'Tis far eaſier to utter many thouſands of Petitions before God, than to lift up one to him believingly. But when the Soul is ſtrengthen'd with all might by the Spirit in this Duty, all the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of unbelief are inſtantly ſubdued; Doubts and Fears of our Acceptance and Succeſs are made to vaniſh; like Shadows that fly away upon the Appearance of the Sun.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Spirit inſtructs us how to Addreſs our ſelves to God as a Father with becoming Reverence.</hi> There muſt be a mixture of this with our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, or elſe we abuſe our Priviledge, inſtead of improving it. The ſame Spirit is a Spirit <hi>of the fear of the Lord,</hi> as well as <hi>of Faith,</hi> Iſa. 11.2. We are not to make ſo bold with God, as not to ſtand in awe of him. The Freedom which God allows us in his Preſence, is not a rude Familiarity; this is not Child-like, for a Father ought to be reſpected by thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:41523:141"/>from him. He muſt be conſider'd as a Superiour, and honour'd accordingly; and the more Kind and Indulgent he is, the more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due. Any behaviour that betrays a ſlight eſteem, or a preſumptuous Contempt of God, is offenſive to him; and they that carry themſelves ſo, have Reaſon to try and condemn the Spirit which they are acted by. He is our Father in Heaven, and we his Children on Earth, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.2. He ſits upon a Throne, and we muſt remember that we Worſhip at his Footſtool.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The Spirit ſtirs up filial Affection to God in Prayer.</hi> This makes it a delightful Exerciſe, as indeed it ſhould be. Do Children count it a burdenſome Task to go to a Father, or are they not rather glad of the Opportunity of Converſe with thoſe that are ſo dear to them? A Slave indeed hath an Averſion to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Lord, as the Bond-woman, <hi>When Sarah dealt hardly with her, fled from her Face,</hi> Gen. 16.6. But when a Child hath to do with a tender Parent, 'tis quite contrary; 'tis ſweet Employment to pour out the Soul into a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Boſom. We ſet about it with Pleaſure, and a Pleaſure which exceeds the Fruition of any Creatures whatſoever. The Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption is a Spirit of Love; and this Love breaths out it ſelf in Holy Deſires to him. The Soul loves to commune with him, for his own ſake, even though we could ſuppoſe; that there were no preſſing occaſion for it; it loves to viſit him not only in Trouble, when Neceſſity drives, but at all other Times, being drawn by internal Motives.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:41523:141"/>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The Spirit helps us to Pray with unwearied Fervency.</hi> It behoves us ſo to do, when we are dealing with a Father, who will certainly be won and prevail'd upon, how deaf or regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſoever he may ſeem to be for a Time Dull and ſtupid formality does not ſuit with the Relation wherein we ſtand; where we look for cold Entertainment, 'tis apt to cool our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts; but <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Opinion of his Fathers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, made him the more earneſt for his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.34, 38. The Children of God are baptized with Fire, their Hearts burn within them, and it would be ſtrange, if their Words ſhould freeze. Theirs is not an Artificial Zeal, which is quickly ſpent; but a Zeal which holds out, till the deſire comes; and by this means they are always Conquerors; and as 'tis ſaid of <hi>I uther (Iſte vir potuit apud Deum quicquid voluit)</hi> they can do what they will with God; they will take no denial, but wreſtle and ſtrive, till they have obtain'd. All this is done by the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of our Father.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Love of God is to be ſeen and admir'd in our Adoption, as much as in any Thing beſides:</hi> The Love of the Father in predeſtinating us to it, the Love of the Son, in procuring it for us, and the Love of the Spirit in teſtifying it to us. 'Tis God's loving us as Children, which is the Foundation and Root of all our Love to him as a Father; for his Love deſcends, before ours aſcends. 'Tis marvellous that God ſhould anſwer to any ſuch Name, when we call him by it, and that he ſhould give us any ſuch Name
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:41523:142"/>himſelf, the Apoſtle breaks forth into a kind of Ecſtaſie and Raviſhment of Spirit, when he conſider'd it; 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold, what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God?</hi> That in the Place, where it was ſaid to us <hi>Gentiles, Ye are not my People,</hi> it ſhould be now ſaid, <hi>You are the Sons of the Living God?</hi> Hoſ. 1.10. Rom. 9.26. Are ſuch vile Prodigals as we, <hi>Worthy to be call'd his Sons?</hi> Luke 15.21. That cannot be ſuppos'd; nor is it for want of other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; that he beſtows this Favour upon us. He hath an Eternal Son, in whom his Soul delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whom he poſſeſt with Infinite Joy before all his Works of Old; or this Favour might have been directed to fallen Angels; but God hath preferr'd us Inferiour Creatures to that which they are excluded from.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Dignity of Believers excels all the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Honour in the World; 'tis of a more glorious Nature, and confirm'd by a greater Teſtimony. By Faith, Moſes refuſed to be call'd the Son of Pharaoh's Daughter,</hi> though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a mighty Prince, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24. <hi>It pleaſed David to be Son-in-law to the King</hi> before he was ſo, but he found little Comfort in it afterwards, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.26. Theſe Relations to the greateſt of Men, are poor trifling, mean and empty Things, in Compariſon of Believer's Relation to God. Magiſtrates are called <hi>Children of the moſt High,</hi> becauſe they bear ſome little faint Repreſentation of God's Authority, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 82.6. But the leaſt of Chriſt's little ones are God's Children in a ſublimer Senſe. 'Tis Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Times more honourable to be a Child of God, then Lord of the whole Earth.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:41523:142"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Walking after the Commandments of Men is a very ungrateful requital of God.</hi> Certainly we owe moſt Duty, where we receive the greateſt Priviledge; and what can Men do for us, to be compar'd with what God hath done, that we ſhould pay any Homage to them, in Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him? 'Tis baſely diſingenuous for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to regard what others ſay, more than the Injunctions of their own Parents. The Senſe of this unſpeakable Benefit of God's adopting us to himſelf, is enough to reſtrain us from yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obedience to Men, that is inconſiſtent with our Obedience to God. This is the meaning and ſcope of that Caution given by Chriſt; <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.9. <hi>Call no Man your Father upon Earth, for one is your Father, which is in Heaven.</hi> That one God whoſe Children we are, hath the only Supream Title to our Allegiance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The poſſibility of Aſſurance, one would think, ſhould be without all Controverſie.</hi> To call it in Queſtion, is to give the lye to this very Text, and to caſt a blaſphemous Reproach upon the Witneſs of the Spirit. 'Tis matter of rejoicing, <hi>to have the ſingle Teſtimony of our own Conſcience for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. For Conſcience (as one ſays) is like a kind of Eccho which makes our ſpiritual Actions reſound, after they are paſt and gone from us; but when we have the concurrent Teſtimony of the Spirit of God, this makes our Joy a great deal more full, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth Witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</hi> The Spirit is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and converſant with the Soul, than the Soul with it ſelf, and is better acquainted with its State; He knows every Child of God by Name, and therefore is beſt able to make us
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:41523:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>know, if we are ſuch; if an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were ſent to tell us, it would not be ſo ſure, <hi>The Spirit that beareth Witneſs of thoſe things, is Truth in the abſtract,</hi> 1 John 5.6. Some may be deluded by a lying Spirit, inſtead of him, but does it follow, that there muſt be no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion which comes of him that call us? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are Counterfeits in the World, are there no Realities? So, the Aſſurance of the ſtrongeſt Believer's may not be compleat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, but is it therefore not true? Our Graces, the Fruits of the Spirit, are all imperfect, but that does not make them falſe and feigned; and Perfection in Comfort is above the ſtandard of this Life, as well as in Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Enquire into your own Adoption.</hi> 'Tis not a Priviledge common to all, ſee whether you have juſt Cauſe to apprehend that 'tis yours. The World hath a mixt Multitude in it; there are Sons of <hi>Belial, and Children of the Devil,</hi> as well as <hi>of God,</hi> 1 John 3.10. There are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Dogs, as well as Children. And there be many who are called the Children of God, and are not ſo indeed; being ſuch only by viſible external Profeſſion, as they were, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. We deceive our ſelves, if we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this, for this will be of no more Advantage to us, than the National Adoption which once belong'd to the <hi>Jews,</hi> is uſeful to them; with Reſpect to which the Apoſtle poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſays, <hi>They which are the Children of the Fleſh, are not the Children of God,</hi> Rom. 9.8. Think not that 'tis enough to be Chriſtians outwardly (any more than to be <hi>Jews</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly)
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:41523:143"/>but look after a real Change of State.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Apply your ſelves to God for this Benefit, if yet destitute of it.</hi> Conſider what miſerable helpleſs Creatures you are in your preſent Caſe, like a wretched Infant that is <hi>cast out into the open Field, in the Day that it is born,</hi> Ezek. 16.5. Go and bemoan your Caſe at the Foot of God; <hi>And as Abraham ſaid to him, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, ſeeing I go Childleſs,</hi> Gen. 15.2. You may much better ſay, what wilt thou give me, ſeeing I go Fatherleſs? What canſt thou give that I can receive any Comfort in? Tell him, that you can never call your ſelves Happy, till you can call him Father, and that you deſire nothing beſides this, in Compariſon of it. The Chief of Sinners may take Encouragement from that bleſſed Text, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.19. Juſtice ſeems to argue againſt it in the former Part of the verſe, and Mercy concludes for it in the latter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Take heed of grieving the Spirit, you who have this Benefit, that you may not loſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Senſe of it.</hi> This depends upon his ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Work; and therefore provoke and offend him not, if you would keep the Impreſſion clear, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. Two Things are eſpecially grievous to the Spirit, which we ſhould beware of, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting his Motions, and oppoſing his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Neglecting his Motions.</hi> When he ſtirs us up to ſeeking of God, and any Act of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, we ſhould ſtir up our ſelves. It is a part of the Character of God's Children, to regard the Spirit's Conduct, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Oppoſing his Testimony.</hi> The indulging of unbelief in our own Hearts, is a Contradiction
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:41523:144"/>to the Spirit's Witneſs. <hi>He is ſent forth to cry, Abba, Father,</hi> unbelief ſays nay, God is not ſo unto me. It will be helpful to Souls in ſuch Temptations, to look to God as the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for this will bring them to Eye him as theirs alſo. See <hi>John</hi> 20.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.2, 3. That Promiſe ſeems to concern both Chriſt and the Believer too; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.26. <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, thou art my Father,</hi> &amp;c. You may venture to ſay that after Chriſt, which otherwiſe you could not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Evidence the Truth of your Sonſhip unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Make it appear that there is indeed a ſubſtantial Difference between you and the Children of this World in every Thing that hath a reſpect to Sin and Duty. If you do as others do, they will have Reaſon to ſuſpect that you are not what you pretend to be. The <hi>Jews</hi> were not to disfigure themſelves, like other People, <hi>becauſe they were the Children of the Lord their God,</hi> Deut. 14.1. Let your ſpot therefore be the ſpot of his Children; let his Image be ſeen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, as well as his Name, that you may (like them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.18.) <hi>Reſemble the Children of ſuch a King.</hi> You muſt be Followers, and Imitators of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1. Or elſe you will give occaſion to Men to think you a ſpurious Brood. You muſt be <hi>blameleſs and harmleſs, and without rebuke</hi> (exemplary and inoffenſive) <hi>in the midst of a perverſe Nation; for ſo are the Sons of God,</hi> Phil. 2.15. Diſorderly Children are a ſhame and ſcandal to their Parents; therefore Credit the Relation wherein you ſtand, by a ſtrict and regular Deportment. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:41523:144"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By a ſober and thankful uſe of every Mercy.</hi> Wanton Prodigals that waſt their Subſtance and miſpend their Portion, are a diſhonour to God's Family, and deſerve to be renounc't. Your Father expects that all which is given by him, ſhould be improved for him. Men rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon it barbarous and unnatural, if their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren turn Rebels againſt them with the Eſtates which they beſtow upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By a patient and humble bearing of every Affliction.</hi> Not that a Fathers Anger is a Light thing, and to be deſpis'd; they muſt be very profligate that think ſo; but all his Rebukes ſhould be receiv'd with great Submiſſion. Nor muſt they drive us from him, but make us come the nearer, and cling the faſter to him; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that God's Corrections endur'd in a right Manner, are Proofs of our Legitimacy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By a reconcileable and forgiving temper to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the worst of Men.</hi> Mat. 5.9. <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi> So <hi>ver.</hi> 44, 45. <hi>Love your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, bleſs them that Curſe you, do good to them that Hate you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That you may be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of your Father which is in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. For this is to tranſcribe his Pattern, and do as he does.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>By living in Love with all our Holy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> They do not walk worthy of ſuch a Relation as this is, that ſhew any Unchriſtian bitterneſs, or unreaſonable ſtrangeneſs towards thoſe that are of the ſame ſtock with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Let us check our ſelves in this Caſe with thoſe Words of the Prophet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.10.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:41523:145"/>
                  <hi>Have we not all one Father? Why do we then deal treacherouſly every Man against his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> To Conclude, Brotherly Kindneſs is the neceſſary Duty of all God's Children, and a neceſſary Token to convince all others that we are ſo.</p>

               <p>AS it is the Apoſtle's manner in his other Epiſtles, to mingle Exhortations to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, with Explications of Faith, ſo here, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the three former Chapters of this Epiſtle given ſome account of the Goſpel Doctrine, he does in the three latter ſtir up to ſuitable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. In the beginning of this Chapter he preſſes worthy Walking with reſpect to thoſe Inſtances of Humility, Meekneſs, and Chriſtian Forbearance, as things which have a ſpecial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the furthering of Unity and Peace. To enforce this, he makes uſe of two ſorts of Motives.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1st.</hi> He argues from ſeveral things which are one and the ſame in the Church of God; which do all tend to faſten and engage us to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>There is one Body, and one Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:41523:146"/>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> He argues from thoſe things in which there is a diverſity, <hi>viz. The Graces of Believers;</hi> for their Diverſity is alſo an Argument to Love and Concord. This is the Subject of the Text, <hi>But unto every one,</hi> &amp;c. The manner of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Argument, with the Particle <hi>But,</hi> plainly ſhews that the Apoſtle here deſigns to prevent an Objection, from God's unequal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of Grace, which corrupt Nature is very apt to make an occaſion of Diviſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed, if well conſidered, 'tis rather a ſtrong and powerful Bond of Union; for ſeeing every one hath his ſeveral Graces from God, and no one hath all, it follows, that we are mutually indigent of each others Aſſiſtance, and ought to be mutually Uſeful in affording it; if one hath that Grace which another wants; and if one wants what another hath, they ſhould therefore agree to be helpers of their Brethren in Chriſt; all Grace being diſpenſed by the ſame Benefactor, proceeding from the ſame Author, and referring to one general End.</p>
               <p>In the Words we have Four Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1st. The thing ſpoken of, [Grace]:</hi> This is a word which hath various Significations in the Scripture: Sometimes 'tis put for Grace in God, his Mercy and Kindneſs, Favour and good Will, in oppoſition to our own Works, or any thing in the Creature; ſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>We are ſaved by Grace, &amp;c.</hi> So we read of <hi>the Election of Grace, Rom.</hi> 11.5. and <hi>Juſtification by Grace, chap.</hi> 3.24. For this is the Foundation and Principle of all that God doth for us; we muſt ſtill cry, <hi>Grace, Grace to it.</hi> Sometimes 'tis put for the Doctrine of Grace, <hi>i.e.</hi> The Goſpel which is truly and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>You are fallen from Grace.</hi> 1 Pet. 5.12.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:41523:146"/>
                  <hi>This is the true Grace of God wherein you ſtand.</hi> Sometimes 'tis put for the Fruits and Effects of the Grace of God in us, and they are twofold, Common Gifts, or ſpecial Graces.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Common Gifts;</hi> which Salvation may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes his Call to the Apoſtleſhip often, by <hi>the Grace given to him, Rom.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.7, 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Special Graces;</hi> ſuch as always accompany Salvation, or carry Salvation in them. Thus a charitable Diſpoſition to relieve the Needy, hath the Title and Character of Grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6, 7. 'Tis probable that Grace may include both Senſes, but I ſhall chuſe to ſpeak chiefly of the latter.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly. The way of Communication, [Is given.]</hi> 'Tis not due or owing to us; God is not oblig'd to impart any thing to us, but he freely promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and freely beſtows it. <hi>He freely gives us all things,</hi> Rom. 8.32. 1 Cor. 2.12. 'tis all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, that which he might have righteouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do. Of his own Will he firſt diſpenſes the Grace of Converſion, and afterwards for our progreſſive Sanctification. His Juſtice does not bind, but his Goodneſs moves him to it. If he had left all Mankind lying in Wickedneſs, as well as thoſe whom he paſſed by, he had been a God without Iniquity. There was no reaſon why he ſhould Reſtore what we had loſt, and Repair what we had defac'd, but becauſe he would.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly. The Perſons that are the Receivers, [To every one of us.] i. e.</hi> Either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To all actual Believers, that are or have been ſince the beginning of the World.</hi> To every one
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41523:147"/>that now hath Grace, or that ever had it, it was and is given. So ſome interpret <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>Every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, is enlightned by him. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To all his choſen Ones, even to the end of the World.</hi> All that are given to Chriſt, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Grace from him. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, he alſo will call,</hi> Rom. 8.30. They to whom Grace was given in the Eternal Purpoſe of God before the World, ſhall be moſt certainly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it in time.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly. The original Spring or Pattern of it, [Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of the Gift of Christ.]</hi> This may be taken either way,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As denoting the Spring of this Grace: i. e.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Liberality and Munificence of Chriſt, and in the meaſure which it pleaſes him to give. This Conſtruction is favoured by the next words, which are a Citation of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>He gave Gifts unto Men.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>As intimating the Pattern of this Grace.</hi> Chriſt is not only the Giver, but the Exemplar of it. There is ſome Correſpondence between the Grace in Chriſt, and in us.

               <p>Obſerv. <hi>There is a Grace given by Christ to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that belongs to him, bearing ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>What Purpoſes does this Grace ſerve for?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>All is included in theſe two Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For the fixing of Holy Principles.</hi> This is what the Apoſtle calls the <hi>establiſhing of the Heart with Grace, Heb.</hi> 13.9. There can be no ſteady walk with God, till this is done. If we be not transformed by Grace in the renewing of our Minds, all other Changes and Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſignifie nothing, and will come to nothing. This only infers a real change of the Man; for the Man is, according as his Principles are, and ſooner or later they will be Operative, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves. A gracious Perſon is one endowed with gracious Habits, and ſettled in a gracious State. It is the Seed abiding in us, which denominates us truly alive to God, or elſe we are no better than Carkaſſes at the beſt, that are cover'd with Flowers or embalm'd with Spices, to keep them from being noiſome and offenſive to others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The producing of Holy Actions.</hi> Where Principles are firſt fixed, theſe Actions flow as a pure ſtream from a clear Fountain. When the Sinner is turn'd into another Man, he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:41523:148"/>ſteers another Courſe. And when he is under the Dominion of Grace, he is not ſo apt to be drawn aſide by contrary Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as one that is got no further, than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Rules and Precepts of Morality. <hi>'Tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Grace of God, which effectually teaches to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts,</hi> Tit. 2.11, 12. This is the prevailing Antidote againſt practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and all manner of licentiouſneſs and ſenſuality. <hi>Hereby we ſerve God acceptably,</hi> Heb. 12.28. <hi>And hereby we have our Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World towards other Men,</hi> ſo as to gain the <hi>rejoycing Teſtimony of a good Conſcience,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. Such Fruits of Righteouſneſs does the Root of the Righteous always yield.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Wherein does this Grace appear to he given?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>Two ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If we conſider the Matter in general;</hi> it muſt needs be given, becauſe the Creature is in no Capacity to claim it as a debt. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Man that hath no Grace, can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to deſerve it.</hi> Nothing that's done by the ſtrength of Nature, can Merit the infuſing of a ſupernatural Power. Nature and Grace differ in kind; and Grace is of a kind more Superiour to Nature, than Heaven is to Earth. There is no Affinity or Compariſon between Fleſh and Spirit, and conſequently none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>that which is born of the Fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit,</hi> John 3.6. What we bring forth in a State of Sin, is all after our own likeneſs; and can this qualifie us for being Created again after the likeneſs of God? All antecedent Diſpoſitions and Preparations riſe no higher than the carnal Standard; they are
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:41523:148"/>ſtill but dead Works, which fall infinitely ſhort of a Divine quickening. If Glory is not to be procur'd by the moſt vigorous Exerciſes of Grace, much leſs Grace by the utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We are ſo far from deſerving Grace, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we do not deſire it.</hi> Whereſoever Grace is ſincerely deſir'd, the good Work is begun. To will is not preſent with us, till God hath wrought it. Whoever covets to partake of God's Holineſs, does in ſome Degree partake of it already. There is an Enmity and Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in corrupt Nature to the Work of ſaving Grace; inſtead of asking and ſeeking after it, we refuſe and reject the offers of it, and riſe up in Arms againſt it, before God hath ſubdued us to himſelf. How can we ſuppoſe that the Old Man ſhould ever crave to be crucifi'd, and reigning Sin affect to be depos'd? We may as well think, that the Devil ſhould wiſh the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of his own Kingdom as that unrenewed Nature, and ſinful Fleſh ſhould deſire the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>We are ſo far from naturally deſiring Grace, that we are not deeply ſenſible of our want of it, till God hath made us ſo.</hi> By a deep Senſe, I mean, a feeling Apprehenſion both of our being deſtitute of Grace, and being undone without it. Now this is impreſt by the Spirit of God, where-ever it is. Graceleſs Perſons either do not know their Condition to be ſo ſinful, or not ſo miſerable, as it is; they think themſelves to have, what they have not, or elſe they are Content to want it, as if there were no need of having it. How then can he deſerve a Cure, who fancies himſelf ſo whole, that he hath no
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:41523:149"/>occaſion for a Phyſician? Or who thinks himſelf bound to beſtow an Alms upon one that is too Proud to beg; and will not own his Neceſſity, but ſays, he is Rich enough? This is our Caſe with Reſpect to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If we examine the Matter more particularly;</hi> there are ſeveral expreſs Inſtances in Scripture, which make it out to us. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Spirit of God, who is the immediate Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of all Grace in us, and therefore call'd the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Zech. 12.10. Is ſaid to <hi>be given us,</hi> Rom. 5.5. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. Or elſe 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that ever we ſhould receive him. Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving implies a giving, <hi>A Man can receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unleſs it be given him from Heaven,</hi> John 3.27. <hi>And therefore the World cannot receive the Spirit, becauſe he was never promiſed,</hi> nor is he <hi>given to the World, Chap.</hi> 14.17. Jeſus Chriſt is not more the Gift of God to poor Sinners, than the Spirit is; they are both equally glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons, and unſpeakable ineſtimable Gifts. The Communication of the Holy Ghoſt is as great an Act of Bounty in God, as the Exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Son.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The New Nature, which is incluſive of all Grace, is repreſented in Scripture as a Gift,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. <hi>A new Heart will I give you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will give you an Heart of Fleſh.</hi> This new Heart, and Heart of Fleſh does vertually comprehend in it every Grace, for all the habits of Grace are infus'd at once, not ſucceſſively one after another; they are all really inherent when we are firſt made new Creatures, though not all on a ſudden eminently viſible. Now this new Heart which conſtitutes a new Creature, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely given; ſo the Covenant runs. God
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:41523:149"/>does not ſay, I will give it you, upon ſuch and ſuch Terms, if you do thus and thus, <hi>but I will give you,</hi> &amp;c. If it were a ſuſpended conditional Promiſe, it might never be performed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Saving Knowledge, which is coupled with Grace,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. And is indeed it ſelf a Grace, <hi>is given.</hi> So God ſays, <hi>I will give them an Heart to know me,</hi> Jer. 24.7. And Chriſt tells his Diſciples, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you ic is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11. 'Tis rich Love and Mercy which makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in this Caſe between ſome and others; between thoſe who remain blind, as they are Born, and thoſe whoſe Eyes are open'd, and that have the Veil upon their Hearts taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. They to whom this Knowledge is given, and they to whom it is not given, are alike unworthy of it, and alike uncapable of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it themſelves, He that gives us natural Light for the guidance of our Bodies, does as truly give ſpiritual Light for the Conduct of our Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Faith is the Gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2.8. As 'tis ſtiled his Work to intimate that his Power is the Cauſe, ſo 'tis call'd his Gift to intimate that his goodneſs is the Motive. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to believe,</hi> Phil. 1.29. The Grace of Faith is communicated to us with the ſame freeneſs as the Object of it is; and if it were not ſo, we ſhould live and dye in our Infidelity. Our Lord poſitively ſays, <hi>John</hi> 6.65. <hi>No Man can come to me, except it be given to him of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> We may as well undertake a perfect ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the whole Covenant of Works, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an Ability of receiving Chriſt, as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in the Goſpel. He is ſet up as the brazen
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41523:150"/>Serpent in the Wilderneſs, and God gives us an Eye to look to him, or elſe we ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the better.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Repentance is God's Gift alſo.</hi> There is no Repentance to Salvation, but what is wrought by the God of Salvation. We may as well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that Light ſhould of it ſelf Spring out of Darkneſs, and ſweet Waters iſſue from a bitter Fountain, as that any ſuch Grace ſhould be the natural Product of our Impenitent Hearts. There is no hope of an Heart <hi>deſperately Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> (as the Heart of every Man by Nature is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9.) unleſs God is pleaſed by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Vertue to Work the Cure, and with an irreſiſtible Hand to turn it to himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. <hi>In meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if peradventure God will give them Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. No Inſtruction will do, if he againſt whom they Sin, do not give them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>How is this Grace, the Gift of Chriſt, as the Text affirms it to be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>In ſix Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>All Things are deliver'd unto him by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> to him as Mediator, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>All things are given into his Hand,</hi> John 3.35. And he hath the diſpoſal of them, according to his own Pleaſure, he may with-hold or diſpenſe every Thing, as he ſees good. <hi>The Son quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whom he will,</hi> Chap. 5.21. He is empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd to <hi>give Eternal Life,</hi> Chap. 10.28. Chap. 17.2. And this Eternal Life is founded in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Now the ground-work is his, as well as the Head-ſtone; the firſt-fruits of Grace, as well as the Harveſt of Glory; the Gift of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:41523:150"/>it ſelf, as well as the Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.14. <hi>The Water which I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him, a Well ſpringing up into Everlaſting Life.</hi> Chriſt hath ſo large a Truſt and Commiſſion from the Father, that nothing is excepted out of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The giving of Grace is one of his eſſential Royalties, as a King.</hi> To give only corruptible Things, is to give as the World giveth; the Men of high Degree ſcatter their Favours of that kind among thoſe that are below them; but it agrees with the Majeſty of Jeſus Chriſt to beſtow that which is of an incorruptible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Principle of Grace and Holineſs, in the Hearts of his People, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and Saviour, to give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> &amp;c. He would be a Prince without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, a meer Titular Prince, if he did not by his own Grace bring them into Subjection and keep them in it. He never ruled in any Heart, which he did not firſt Conquer; rebellious Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would never ſubmit and yield themſelves to his Authority, if he did not make them <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the day of his Power,</hi> Pſalm 110.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt is given to be an Head of Influence, as well as of Government to his Church.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to be <hi>the Head of the Body,</hi> Col. 1.18. Now as every Part of the natural Body derives Spirits from the Head, ſo every Part of the myſtical Body gracious Influences from Chriſt. There is an effectual working from him, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. And how is this effectual working, but by the Communication of his Grace to the various Members? This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> what <hi>Paul</hi> experienc'd, and gives an account of, with Reference to his own firſt Converſion,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:41523:151"/>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Grace of our Lord was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abundant, with Faith and Love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. Paul</hi>'s Heart was full of unbelief, and hatred before, but the prevailing Grace of Chriſt, in whom he was choſen before the World, planted Faith and Love in the room of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>'Tis the Work of Chriſt to furniſh thoſe whom be unites and eſpouſes to himſelf, with Beauty and Ornaments fit for his Embraces;</hi> and wherein does this Beauty conſiſt, and what are theſe Ornaments, but a Participation of his Grace? Some are ready to cry, is a deformed filthy Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner meet to lye in Chriſt's Boſom? But I would Reply, who makes the Sinner meet, beſides Chriſt himſelf? He can have no complacency or delight in ſuch an one continuing as he is; but his Manner is to impart a commending love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs where he loves. As <hi>Rebeckah</hi> was adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Jewel's of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s giving, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.53. So it was granted to the Lambs Wife that <hi>ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine Linne,</hi> &amp;c. of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8. For as the imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, ſo the inherent Righteouſneſs of Saints is his Gift, whom they are married to.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſt hath the right of diſtributing Grace, as the Effect of his Purchaſe.</hi> He hath bought it with his Blood, and therefore may confer it on whom he pleaſes; as we know that every one may do what he Will with his own, and what we buy at a valuable Price, is undoubedtly our own. Upon this ſcore all Grace is the Grace of Chriſt; 'tis his juſt Propriety, and he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ain'd it at the deareſt Rate which could be demanded. <hi>He gave himſelf for the Church, that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:41523:151"/>he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25 26. Our Sanctification was one end of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; and as it was he that ſuffer'd, ſo 'tis he that ſanctifies. Chriſt merited Grace for us by his Death, and therefore the diſpenſing of it is his due.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Spirit of Grace, is ſent by Chriſt, and ſupplies his Place.</hi> John 16.7. <hi>If I depart, I will ſend him to you.</hi> So that he Acts as in Chriſt's Name, and on his behalf, and conſequently what the Spirit does, may be attributed unto Chriſt, and what he divides to every Man, may be very well look't upon as allotted by Chriſt, whoſe Spirit he is; for ſo he is called, <hi>the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.17, 18. There is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heart of Chriſt in all the Spirits ſaving O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations; they are directed by his Infinite Wiſdom and Care to all thoſe whom he laid down his Life for. As <hi>he ſhed forth the Holy Ghoſt at Pentecoſt,</hi> Acts 2.33. So the pouring of him out at all Times is his continual Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſtill.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>After what manner is this Grace given to every one that belongs to Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Negatively and Poſitively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. <hi>Negatively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. <hi>This Grace is not given to all by the ſame Inſtruments and Means.</hi> 'Tis moſt uſually by the Word of Grace, but ſometimes by the Rod of ſanctified Affliction; 'tis oftneſt by the Sword in Chriſt's Mouth, but it may be, by the Fan in his Hand. Ordinarily 'tis by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt's Embaſſadors; but ſometimes the edifying Diſcourſes of Private Chriſtians may Miniſter <hi>Grace to the Hearers,</hi> Eph. 4.29. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:41523:152"/>though it be by the ſame Goſpel, yet God makes uſe of ſeveral Publiſhers: They whom he ſanctifies through the Truth, are Converted by ſeveral Perſons. There are many ſpiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſome are begotten in Chriſt by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of one, and ſome by another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is not given to all at the ſame Age or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of Life:</hi> As in that Parable of the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Vineyard, ſome were called at the third Hour, ſome at the ſixth, ſome at the ninth, ſome at the eleventh. Some are ſanctified from the Womb, <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> like <hi>John,</hi> from their very Birth; <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15. Others it may be, wear out almoſt all their Lives, and are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dropping into the Grave, before they are brought home to God. Some are planted into Chriſt in their tender Years, like <hi>Paul,</hi> when a Young Man; others not born again till they are Old, <hi>when the evil Days come.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not ſo material or requiſite for us to know, when we felt the firſt workings of Grace, as to be ſure that we feel it's real work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings now.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is not given to all in her ſame remarkable Circumſtances.</hi> The Kingdom of God comes with more Obſervation into ſome Souls, than into others. Some are more gently, others more ſharply dealt with; the Travel of the Soul, at the New-birth, is not with the ſame ſenſible Difficulty and Anguiſh in all Perſons. Some paſs from Death to Life, with greater Convulſions, <hi>Like that noiſe and ſhaking, when the dry Bones came together,</hi> Ezek. 37.7. Others are call'd with a more ſtill Voice and drawn to Chriſt in a more ſoft and ſilent way. Grace is ſometimes introduc'd by deep Humiliations,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:41523:152"/>great brokenneſs extraordinary diſquiet, at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Times it inſinuates it ſelf into the Soul, with leſs of thoſe Preparatives, and therefore leſs diſcernably.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is not given to all in the ſame Meaſure.</hi> To ſome more Grace, to others leſs. Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs is beſtow'd alike upon every one, no one is made more righteous by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Chriſt, than another; but as to the Gift of ſanctifying Righteouſneſs there are vaſtly different Degrees. Some in God's <hi>Iſrael,</hi> like <hi>Saul,</hi> higher from the Shoulders and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, others like <hi>Zacchens,</hi> little of Stature. Some Weak, others Strong in Faith; ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for ſpiritual Underſtanding; <hi>But there is not in every one that Knowledge,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.7. Some are even conſum'd by their Zeal for God; but all are not ſuch lively Stones, <hi>Song</hi> 1.17. <hi>The Beams of our Houſe are Caedar, and our Raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Firr.</hi> As Beams in God's building bear greateſt weight, ſo Caedar is of greateſt worth.</p>

Every Member of Chriſt, even ſuch as we think to be leaſt honourable, hath this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour beſtowed upon it, to be made a partaker of the Holy Ghoſt, and partaker of him ſo, as never to fall away. <hi>For this is a Gift which is without Repentance,</hi> Rom. 11.29. As to thoſe that are God's workmanſhip in Chriſt, it never Repents him that he hath new made them. Whom he once effectually draws, he never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers abſolutely to draw back' The Devil may ſteal the Word out of Men's Hearts, before 'tis
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:41523:153"/>engraffed there by the Spirit, but afterwards he cannot.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is Grace given to every one, which is of the ſame kind in every one.</hi> All God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the little ones, as well as thoſe that are more advanc't to greater ripeneſs and maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have the ſame <hi>Divine Nature</hi> infus'd into them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. They are all Created again after the Image of God, which as to the Subſtance of it, is the ſame in all, though there be ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in leſſer Features. <hi>They all obtain like precious Faith,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1. The Faith of God's Elect, is all alike, in regard of its main and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Fruits. In every one, it purifies the Heart, overcomes the preſent World, realizes unſeen Things, though it does not work and act in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one with equal Vigour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There are ſupplies of Grace given to every one; for as all Creatures do neceſſarily depend upon God for their natural Beings, ſo God's new Creatures eſpecially for the continuance and increaſe of their ſpiritual Life.</hi> From the Day that they firſt know the Grace of God in Truth, there are further Communications every Day of more Grace, both in order to Eſtabliſhment and Growth. How much ſoever God hath already vouchſaf'd it would be of fatal Conſequence, if he ſhould ſtop his Hand. God is always giving, that we may retain and improve what we have receiv'd before. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. <hi>He ſhall come unto us as the Rain, as the latter and former Rain unto the Earth:</hi> As the former Rain which opens the Womb of the Earth to take in the Seed, and as the latter which ſerves to plump and ſwell the Fruit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There is Grace given to every one ſuitable to their Condition.</hi> 1 Cor 7.7. <hi>Every Man hath his
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:41523:154"/>proper Gift of God,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) a Gift pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to himſelf; <hi>one after this manner, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after that.</hi> As Chriſt ſpeaks of a ſaying, <hi>Which all Men cannot receive, ſave they to whom 'tis given,</hi> Mat. 19.11. Some Men have leſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery over their Affections, and God by his wiſe Providence caſts their Lot accordingly. Some are exercis'd with more Temptations, and ſuch God furniſhes with more Strength to reſiſt and ſtand againſt them. Some are call'd to more eminent Services, and then God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges their Capacity of performing them. It is ſtill ſo manag'd by him who knows our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that they whoſe Condition requires moſt Grace, have moſt.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>What Proportion and Similitude does the Grace given to us, bear to the Grace which was in Christ?</hi> Here Premiſe a few Things to prevent miſunderſtanding, and then State the Truth it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To Premiſe a few Things, to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding.</hi> As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Grace in Christ to which the Grace in Believers bears any Proportion, is to be understood of his Grace as Man, the Grace which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to his Humane Nature.</hi> Pſalm 45.2. <hi>Thou art fairer than the Children of Men; Grace is poured into thy Lips.</hi> His gracious Words, which often ſtruck the Hearers with wonder and amazement, flowed from this Spring; and therefore in that Character which the Spouſe gives of him. <hi>His Lips are deſcrib'd like Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies dropping ſweet ſmelling myrrh,</hi> Song 5.13. Jeſus Chriſt as God, was the God of all Grace, the Original Fountain of it in himſelf, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:41523:154"/>of it to us; as Man he was a Veſſel that receiv'd it by Derivation; it was truly given to him, as it was given to the firſt Man <hi>Adam.</hi> When God created him. And this is that Grace of Chriſt, which our Grace does eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Grace which is given by Christ to every one of his Members, is not the ſame individual Grace which was given to him by the Father.</hi> We are not endowed with that very ſame particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inherent Holineſs which he was, for then we muſt ſuppoſe him to be diveſted of it at the ſame Time. Thoſe gracious Qualities which were lodg'd in Chriſt, cannot be transferr'd to us, for Qualities cannot paſs from one Subject to another, or belong to more than one at once. The ſame Righteouſneſs which Chriſt fulfill'd, is imputed and reckon'd to us for our Juſtification; as the ſame Money which the Surety lays down, is judicially and legally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be paid by the Debtor; but the ſame righteous Habits cannot be infus'd into Chriſt and Believers, not the ſame in number, though the ſame in Kind. The Caſe is plain, becauſe the Perſon of Chriſt, and the Perſons of Believers are really diſtinct; they are united indeed, but not by a perſonal Union (for then there would be as many Chriſts, as there are Believers, whereas there is but one Lord Jeſus Chriſt) they make up one Myſtical Body, but not one natural Perſon; therefore his Grace and theirs muſt numerically differ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Grace given to Christ, was to ſerve ſome ſpecial Purpoſes and Ends, which the Grace given to us is not adapted for.</hi> He was not only made under the Ceremonial Law, and under
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:41523:155"/>the Moral, as others were, but under a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Law, which concern'd himſelf only, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. There is a vaſt Difference between the Work of Chriſt as Mediator, and the Work of an ordinary Chriſtian; and therefore beſides the ſtock of habitual Grace, of which his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was poſſeſt, he had the Godhead alſo to ſupport him; and there was abſolute need of it. There was more Service and Duty incumbent upon Jeſus Chriſt, than ever was upon any meer Creature before or ſince. The Active and Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt exceeds all that any Man was ever called to do or ſuffer. Our work under the Influence of his Grace, hath a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Reſpect to our own Salvation, he was to work out the Salvation of all his Elect in a way of proper Merit and Satisfaction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Grace in him, and in us are not equally perfect; they are not like Parallel Lines which run the ſame length.</hi> No Believer can pretend to be ſo full of Grace, as he was; our receivings are far from coming up to the ſame meaſure with his. Chriſt had an extraordinary anointing in a larger Quantity; we have it drop't in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon upon us. <hi>He as the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Mal. 4.2. We as twinkling Stars; <hi>He as the King of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Heb. 7.2. We as Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Subjects. Grace is Chriſt was like Water in a wide Sea which hath no viſible Bounds; Grace in us, is like Water in a little Brook, or a narrow River. Grace in him, was in ſinleſs Perfection at the firſt, in us it is never ſo, while we are in this World; there are mixtures of ſinful Infirmity with all the Grace which we have or Exerciſe. He had abundance of Grace cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no Corruption, we compar'd with him,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:41523:155"/>have a great deal of Corruption beſetting a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To State the Truth it ſelf, as it is in this Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Grace which is in Believers bears ſome Proportion and Similitude to the Grace which is in Chriſt, as it proceeds from one and the ſame Spirit. The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, and make him of quick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in the Fear of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 11.2, 3. All Holy Communications to Chriſt and us are the immediate Effects of this Bleſſed Spirit, the Third Perſon in the Godhead. He was ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, when he was ſent into the World, ſo are we, when called out of the World, and tranſlated into his inviſible Kingdom. As Chriſt gives us the ſame Glory, <hi>Which the Father gave to him,</hi> John 17.22. So he fills us with the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit which he had himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt's Grace and ours have one general Scope and Aim,</hi> viz. <hi>The glorifying of God.</hi> No Grace can be of the right Seed, but what is levell'd at the Honour of the Giver. As it is God's Deſign in giving it, ſo it will be our Deſign in acting it, if it be acted with Integrity. Chriſt who had ſo rich a Furniture of Grace, ſought not his own Glory, nor the exalting of himſelf: <hi>But he glorified God on the Earth,</hi> John 17.4. This is what he had an Eye to in all he did; ſo every Believer intends and purſues the ſame Thing: 'Tis as much his buſineſs to glorifie God, as it is his Pleaſure to enjoy him. Grace conſecrates even his natural Actions to ſerve and promote this noble End; the Actions of Eating and Drinking, which in others are only perform'd for Neceſſity, or elſe for Luſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:41523:156"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>As Chriſt had every Grace, ſo hath the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, though none in the highſt Degree.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus was a compleat Copy of univerſal Righteouſneſs; none could ſay to him, as he ſaid to the Young Man, <hi>One Thing thou lackeſt.</hi> So as to the kinds of Grace, they that belong to Chriſt, are likewiſe <hi>perfect and entire, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing,</hi> James 1.4. <hi>And they ſtand compleat in all the Will of God,</hi> Col. 4.12. they are not endued with ſome Graces, and deſtitute of others; but where one is, there is all. <hi>If a a Liar,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20. Theſe Things are not ſeparable, any more than you can divide Chriſt from himſelf. Whereſoever Faith is, there is Repentance, and new Obedience; that's a Counterfeit Faith, which is alone; 'tis Dead, and therefore cannot be true, <hi>James</hi> 2.17. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Graces are always in Connection; <hi>They make up the one Chain on the Spouſes Neck, which raviſhes the Heart of Chriſt,</hi> Song 4.9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Matter of his Grace and ours is the ſame.</hi> The new Creature is therefore ſet forth by <hi>Chriſt formed in us,</hi> Gal. 4.19. Becauſe of the Agreement and Conformity betwixt the ſtamp of God's Holineſs upon the Humane Soul of Chriſt, and the Souls of them that believe. Hence the ſame Mind is ſaid to be <hi>in us, as was in him,</hi> Phil. 2.5. The ſame humble, meek, ſelf-denying, ſelf-reſigning Temper. So <hi>he that doth Righteouſneſs, is Righteous, even as he is Righteous,</hi> 1 John 3.7. 'Tis the ſame Rule of Righteouſneſs obſerv'd by both, and ſo the ſame ſpecifical Work of Righteouſneſs perform'd by both. That Law which was perfectly obey'd by Chriſt, is ſincerely obey'd by all that are
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:41523:156"/>Chriſt's. <hi>A new Commandment write I unto you, which Thing is true in him, and in you,</hi> 1 John 2.8. That Law which was in his Heart, is in ours, if we be Partakers of Chriſt; and that which govern'd his exemplary Life, will govern ours alſo.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Many Things follow from hence, both for our Learning and Practiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For our Learning.</hi> As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If Grace it ſelf be given, then nothing done by the help of Grace, can be meritorious of Glory.</hi> If our firſt ſtock, and all our Improvements are from God, and vouchſafed freely, What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward can we challenge for any thing we do? God is ſo much before-hand with us, that he can never be oblig'd or indebted to us; if we were capable of firſt giving to him, we might expect a recompence and requital; but (ſays God) <hi>Who hath prevented me, that I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay him?</hi> Job 41.11. We do not prevent God with Duty, but he prevents us with Grace; and therefore we owe all that we can do to God, and a great deal more, we can never anſwer the Engagements which we are under, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the thouſandth part of what he might require from us; ſo that 'tis impoſſible for the leaſt or loweſt Degree of Favour to be due from him. All our returns of Service and Obedience to God are built upon the Foundation of Grace receiv'd, we do but give him of his own, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14. And therefore the Gift of Eternal Life cannot flow from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive Juſtice, but muſt be a further Act of undeſerved Bounty.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:41523:157"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If Grace be given, Glory cannot be denied; for though Glory is not merited by Grace, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways entailed upon it, becauſe the ſame Mercy is the conſtant never failing Spring of both. The Lord will give Grace and Glory,</hi> Pſalm 84.11. Theſe Things are continually coupled, like the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which enter'd into <hi>Noah's Ark, two by two of every Kind</hi> (Gen. 7.15.) as God never gives Glory, where he with-holds his Grace; ſo on the other ſide, where Grace is diſpenſed, Glory is never kept back. Indeed Glory is but the perfecting of the Gift of Grace; the Difference betwixt them is only gradual; Grace is Glory in the Bud, and Glory is Grace full blown. Therefore the Names of Grace and Glory are promiſcuouſly given to one another; ſometimes Grace is ſtiled Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Glory called Grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If Grace be given to every one that is in Chriſt, then every ſuch one is worthy of our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Eſteem.</hi> Whereſoever the Truth of Grace is, it calls for more of our Love and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reſpect, than all the Wealth, and Power, and Greatneſs in the World. The ſmalleſt grain of ſaving Faith is more precious than thouſands of Gold and Silver, and 'tis ſo precious in all that have it, that one ſhould not be ſet up in Competition with another. Every gracious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is really amiable and valuable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a partial Regard to ſuch or ſuch only, is ſinful and groundleſs. No one is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, ſo as that another ſhould be underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued; one is not to be had in Admiration and another in Contempt; but all are to be lookt upon <hi>as Heirs together of the Grace of Life.</hi> He that ſincerely Loves any one for the ſake of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:41523:157"/>Holineſs (without little by Reſpects) will love all Saints on the ſame account.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>If Grace be given to every one according to a particular meaſure, it muſt needs be dangerous to attempt more than this meaſure will extend to.</hi> 'Tis unwarrantable Preſumption to undertake what is above our Reach and beyond our Strength. Therefore <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>That he did not exerciſe himſelf in great Matters, nor in Things too high for him,</hi> Pſalm 131.1. <hi>He that deſires the Office of a Goſpel-Biſhop deſires a good work, and yet Novices are forbidden it,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.1. with 6. Our ſanctified Abilities are only in Part, and deſign'd of God to fit us for that Place and Calling in which we are. Over-bold adventuring, where we are uncall'd, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to Temptations unaſſiſted. <hi>Peter</hi>'s raſh Zeal in the Garden, was a means of betraying him to ſinful Cowardiſe in the Palace of the High-Prieſt. The Evangeliſt therefore takes notice of his being queſtion'd by a Kinſman of <hi>Malchus, whoſe Ear he had cut off,</hi> John 18.26.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If Grace be given from Chriſt to every one, 'tis the great concern of every one to know him, and the main Work of thoſe whom be ſends, to make him known. If he be all, and in all,</hi> Col. 3.11. If he be the common Publick Treaſury, out of which every Soul is ſpiritually enricht, and we have nothing but what comes through his Hands firſt, we have nothing, if we are ignorant of him. And they do little Service to the Churches who only bow at his Name, and make no mention of his Righteouſneſs or Grace; they that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to come from him, and are ſilent concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, ſeem like to Meſſengers that have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their Errand, and tell a formal Story which
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:41523:158"/>hath no Relation to it, and ſignifies nothing to them that hear it. Such as expect any ſhare of his ſaving Benefits, ſhould ſeek to be led into Acquaintance with his Perſon.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>If there be ſuch a Likeneſs and Affinity between the Grace which was in Chriſt, and which is in thoſe that belong to him, they are no Chriſtians, that do not Reſemble Chriſt, and that are not Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of him.</hi> This is that which makes all real Chriſtians truly glorious, and the Glory of Chriſt, as the Woman is ſaid <hi>to be the Glory of the Man,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.7. She reflects the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the Man, ſo do they the Excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt. As Face anſwers to Face in the Glaſs, ſo do they to him. They are planted in the ſimilitude of his Death and Reſurrection; <hi>i. e.</hi> made conformable to both, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. As they are Created in Chriſt, ſo they are Created after his Model. They are his Brethren, and he the firſt-born among them; and as the firſt in every Kind uſes to be a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard and preſident to the reſt, ſo is he. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, they do not abide in Chriſt, nor are they related to him, that do not imitate his walk, and follow his ſteps. We ſhall never have Bodies like unto his glorious Body, except we have Souls like his; if we do not bear his heavenly Image now, we ſhall not at the laſt. We deceive our ſelves with vain Hopes, and others with a vain Profeſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For Practiſe.</hi> To thoſe that are yet grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and to them that are truly gracious.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What ſhould they do, that are yet gracleſs?</hi> (For ſome of that ſort may without breach of Charity be ſuppos'd in every Aſſembly; we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read but of one ſo pure, as to be without
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:41523:158"/>ſuch a mixture; and that was, when Chriſt Preacht his Farewel Sermon to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 14.15, 16. Chapters, after <hi>Judas</hi> was gone out, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.30, 31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Labour to be ſenſible of your wretchedneſs, while entirely under the Power of Sin, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Coruption.</hi> If ſo great and good a Man as <hi>Paul</hi> cried out of himſelf as wretched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe deliver'd only in part <hi>from the Body of Death,</hi> Rom. 7.24. How much more miſerable muſt you be, that are not at all deliver'd from it? When the ſecond Temple was building, which was greatly Inferiour to the former, God puts it to the People, <hi>Who is left among you, that ſaw this Houſe in her firſt Glory? And how do you ſee it now? Is it not in your Eyes in Compariſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as nothing?</hi> Hag. 2.3. So if any of us had ever ſeen the Humane Nature cloathed with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Righteouſneſs before the entrance of Sin, which was our Houſe in its Primitive Glory, what a woful ruinous heap ſhould we diſcern it now to be?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Improve this Conviction to the deepeſt Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</hi> The moſt proſtrate Frame of Soul, is always the Foundation which God laies and builds upon. <hi>He giveth Grace to the lowly and humble,</hi> Prov. 3.34. <hi>James</hi> 4.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. The Spirit of God, which deſcends like a Dove, does uſually light upon the Ground, not upon high and lofty Trees. The firſt ſtep of <hi>Paul's</hi> Converſion, who had been an haughty Superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious <hi>Phariſce</hi> before, lifting up himſelf, as the reſt of that Sect did, was his falling to the Earth, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.4. Fountains are not wont to break out in the Tops of Hills; but it is the Method of God in Nature, to ſend the Springs
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:41523:159"/>
                  <hi>into the Valleys,</hi> Pſalm 104.10. And all Waters run into the loweſt Places; ſo do the Influences of Grace fall upon thoſe that are moſt abaſed in their own Minds.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Go to God in Chriſt by Prayer for this bleſſed Gift.</hi> It was never denied to any one that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely ſought it in this Way. Direct your Prayers particularly to Chriſt himſelf, to whom the Diſpenſation of Grace is committed. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Words to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> John 4.10. <hi>If thou kneweſt the Gift of God, and who it is,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou wouldſt have asked of him, and he would have given,</hi> &amp;c. He is as willing to beſtow it, as he is able; believe this, and apply to him accordingly. We may err in the reſtraining of all our Worſhip to the Father, as if none were due to the Son. Why ſhould not we addreſs as well to our Lord Jeſus to renew our Spirits, as <hi>Stephen,</hi> to receive his Spirit?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Reſolve not to be ſatisfi'd or diſmiſs'd without this Gift.</hi> This may be ſafely reſolv'd, and 'tis a Reſolution very pleaſing to God. If you do but ſay, with full Purpoſe of Heart, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, <hi>I will not let thee go,</hi> &amp;c. He cannot wreſt himſelf out of your Hands, but you muſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly prevail. If you give God any reſt, you may look for a Refuſal; if you can be Content without Grace, you will never receive it. The Rich who feel not the Extremity of Want, are but indifferent Beggars, and therefore <hi>God ſends them empty away,</hi> Luke 1.53. Take hold of God's Feet, and go not from his Throne of Grace, till you have obtain'd what you go for.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Be found in the ordinary Road of receiving; as the People that brought their Sick into the Streets,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:41523:159"/>and laid them on Beds and Conches, in the way, where Peter was to paſs,</hi> Acts 5.15. They that are deſirous of the Alms of ſpiritual Wiſdom, muſt attend at Wiſdoms-gates, where the Alms are generally given out. 'Tis wicked Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to expect Grace from God in a careleſs neglect of the Means of Grace. They that truſt in them, and they that forbear to uſe them, are both far from the Kingdom of God. If Faith comes by hearing, 'tis our Duty to wait for it in Hearing, and not to think that it ſhould be wrought by Miracle.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Put away as much as lies in your Power, all that tends to hinder this Gift of Grace.</hi> Though you are unable to qualifie your ſelves for it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to prepare the way of the Lord in your own Hearts, yet to do what you are able to do, is certainly ſuch Advice as you ought to take. You cannot mortifie the inward Love of Sin, but you can keep your ſelves from many outward Acts of Sin. You cannot (it may be) overcome ſome Temptations, when you are in them, but you can chuſe whether you'will run deſignedly into them. Now he that pretends to look up to God for Grace, and at the ſame time wilfully obſtructs it by his own contrary Practiſe, is a groſs and ſhameful Hypocrite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To thoſe that are truly gracious?</hi> What ſhall they do?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Do not diſown this Gift.</hi> This is miſtaken Modeſty, and real unthankfulneſs. We ought not to make our ſelves Poor, when we have great Riches; as if we were hir'd by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer of the Brethren to bear falſe Witneſs againſt our ſelves. The Saints that are in Chriſt Jeſus, gratifie the Father of lies as much by
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:41523:160"/>ſaying they have no Grace, as by ſaying, they have no Sin. For a Man to proclaim his own goodneſs is a fault on one Hand, to deny it, is an extream on the other Hand. The Apoſtle hath directed us to the true medium, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>I ſay, through the Grace given unto me, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man that is among you, not to think of himſelf more highly than he ought to think, but to think ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Be ſure to acknowledge it as a Gift.</hi> Be not pufft up with that which comes down from above. <hi>If thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou Glory, as if thou hadſt not received it,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. As we are not to boaſt of things without our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo things within our meaſure, are no juſt ground or matter of boaſting. If God hath given that to us which he hath not to others, what Reaſon have we to be proud of it? If we had earned it by our own Induſtry and Labour, Activity and Diligence, we might have ſome Cloak for ſpiritual Pride; but as it is, we have none at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Take heed of luſting to Envy againſt thoſe that go beyond you.</hi> There is a ſifnul Emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in holy things; a repining at that wherein we ſhould Rejoyce, a ſecret Grief that others do ſo well, inſtead of an hearty ſhame, that we do no better. For the Cure of this, remember all is given; and if your Gift be leſs than another Man's, you muſt not murmur and complain, as if God had done you any wrong. Bleſs God that ſome have the Grace which you want, and by that means are more ſerviceable than you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Do not think however that a little of this Grace is enough, or any meaſure ſhort of Perfection.</hi> Be ſtill crying, Give, give; continue ſtill ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>IT is no Diminution to the Authority of theſe Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that this concluding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt be ſuppoſed to be added by another hand; whether by <hi>Eleazer</hi> his Nephew, or <hi>Joſhua</hi> his Succeſſor, is uncertain: 'Tis enough that it was done with the direction of the Spirit of God, by ſome Holy Perſon, whom he thought fit to appoint for that purpoſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> had been admoniſh'd by God at two ſeveral times, of his approaching Death, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.12, 13. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.49, 50. This Chapter gives an account of his actual Deceaſe. In the foregoing Verſes we have a relation of his going up to Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> to the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> and of the view which he had from thence of the Promiſed Land; whereupon God plainly and poſitively tells him, <hi>I have cauſed thee to ſee it with thine Eyes, but thou ſhalt not go over thither,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:41523:162"/>Verſe</hi> 4. the Proſpect of it muſt ſatisfy thee, without the Poſſeſſion. And this did ſatisfy the Man <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was very meek above all other Men; for immediately we read, <hi>So Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> In which wors we may take notice of three Things,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Moſes <hi>his Honourable Character, [Moſes the Servant of the Lord.]</hi> This is the Title which God himſelf puts upon him a little after, in his Charger to <hi>Joſhua, Moſes my Servant is dead,</hi> Joſh. 1.2. and he is ſo ſtiled in the New Teſtament likewiſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. <hi>They ſang the Song of Moſes the Servant of God.</hi> This ſeems eſpecially to refer to the eminent Service which he did to God in his Publick Office, as Leader and Governor of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> for the ſame cauſe hath the ſame Character in the Titles of <hi>Pſalms</hi> 18. and 36. And ſo Miniſters that are employed in the Diſpenſation of the everlaſting Goſpel, are called in a peculiar manner, <hi>The Servants of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24. And they who are Faithful in that Service, are more dignified thereby, than any of the Prophane Princes of this World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Theplace of his Death; He [died there in the Land of Moab:] i. e.</hi> A Land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, <hi>Balak</hi>'s Country originally, till taken by the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and now Conquer'd by the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites.</hi> Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> died in <hi>Egypt,</hi> a ſtrange Land; and indeed in ſome ſenſe we all do ſo; for in that better Country to which we properly belong, there is no more Death. Though our Lord hath overcome this World for us, we are but Pilgrims in it; and by Death we paſs out of it to our promiſed Inheritance.</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:41523:162"/>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The true Ground and Reaſon of it; [Accordig to the Word of the Lord.] i. e.</hi> As God had order'd and enjoin'd him to do. As <hi>Simeon,</hi> to whom it had been revealed, that <hi>he ſhould not ſee Death, till he had ſeen the Lords Christ,</hi> Luke 2.29. when he came and ſaw him in the Temple, crys out, <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace, according to thy Word,</hi> ver. 29. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, that this Word of the Lord to <hi>Moſes, to dle there,</hi> ſeems to be an hard ſaying, and he might have raiſed many Carnal Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt it. He was now in a ſtate of Health and Vigour, not wearied and ſpent by Sickneſs and Pain, or the Infirmities of declining Years; his Eye was not dim, nor his natural Force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated; and he was ſhort of the Age to which many of the Patriarchs arrived; he was but an Hundred and twenty Years old, <hi>ver</hi> 7. He had ſpent very near a third part of his time in the moſt Toilſom Employment, bearing the Burden of Forty Years tedious march through an How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Wilderneſs. and yet now when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the edge, as it were, of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he muſt die upon the Mount. When he had gone ſo far, another muſt enter into his Labours, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Glory of perfecting the Work; not one of his Poſterity (which might be ſome Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> that he was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by his Son, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.28.) but <hi>Joſhua</hi> his Servant, one that had attended him, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to him; one that had envied for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s ſake, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.28, 29. and yet <hi>Moſes</hi> now, upon a much greater Temptation, does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy for his ſake, but delivers up his Charge, and breaths out his Soul, by the ſoveraign and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputed Appointment of God. And therefore
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:41523:163"/>from this ſingular and remarkable inſtance, we may be all inſtructed in our own Duty.</p>
               <p>Obſerv. <hi>To die according to the Will of God, is a great and neceſſary Act of our Chriſtian Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> Here,
<list>
                     <item>I. Shew, How the Will of God is concern'd in our Death.</item>
                     <item>II. What ſort of Obedience we are to yeild to it.</item>
                     <item>III. Why we ſhould do ſo.</item>
                     <item>IV. Apply it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>How the Will of God is concerned in our Death?</hi> This will appear in ſeveral things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The general Sentence of Mortality pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd upon fall Creatures, is the reſult of the Will of God; the common Death of all Men, ſince Sin entred the World, is by a Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Men did, becauſ God hath ſaid they ſhall do ſo; becauſe he hath reſolv'd and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it, not meerly becauſe they are compounded of Fleſh and Blood, which is a Frame that's liable to be diſſolv'd; for we were of the ſame make, as to our natural Subſtance, in our innocent State, wherein if we had remain'd, we ſhould not have died. It is as much in the Power of God to preſerve and defend us from ſeeing Corruption now, as it was before; but his Will is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Death reigns now univerſally by a Power given to it from above; He who changes not, hath ordained that this Change ſhall come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Death hath its particular Commiſſion from God, with reſpect to particular Perſons.</hi> As God ſpeaks of <hi>numbring men to the Sword,</hi> Iſa.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:41523:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>65.12. like Sheep which are pick'd out of a Flock, and deſign'd for ſlaughter. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.2. <hi>ſuch as are for death, to death; and ſuch as are for the ſword, to the ſword,</hi> &amp;c. The Deſtroyer cannot come near, but only where God hath devoted and ſet apart for Deſtruction before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. Hence thoſe diſtinguiſhing Dealings of Providence, not only with them under the ſame Roof, but in the ſame Bed; <hi>one taken, and the other left,</hi> Luke 17.34. The Peſtilence which walks in darkneſs, is guided by God to ſeize on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon ſuch as he hath mark'd out; and it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver touches any one whom God will ſpare, though Thouſands and Ten thouſands fall beſides him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Circumſtance of Time in dying is fix'd and ſettled by the Will of God.</hi> As we read how Chriſt <hi>knew that his hour was come, that he ſhould depart out of the World to the Father,</hi> John 13.1. ſo every Child of God hath ſuch a determinate hour, yea minute, though we know not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily of its coming, as our Lord did. Every one hath his ſet time of removing out of this earthly Houſe, which can neither be haſtned nor delay'd. Every one hath his Portion and Share of Life it ſelf, as well as of the Comforts of it, aſſign'd by God, and when that Portion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, we are truly full of Days, whether we have lived long in the World, or a little while. No Man can die till then, and after that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to live. It is certain, that to this point we ſhall come, and as certain that we ſhall not go beyond it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The place of our Death is limited by the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and pleaſure of God, as well as the of our Habitation, while we live.</hi> He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:41523:164"/>not only when, but where, our Spirits ſhall reutrn to him. He calls (as it were) to every Man out of Heaven, though not ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly as to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Die thou there;</hi> upon that ſpot of Ground thy Carkaſs ſhall fall; as God ſaid concerning <hi>Ahab</hi> with reference to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi>'s Field, which he had gotten by Murder, <hi>I wil requite thee in this plat,</hi> 2 Kings 9.26. One perhaps is ſtruck in a Religious Aſſembly, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Cloſet, one in the City, another in the Field, one at Home, another Abroad; but all exactly in that place which was allotted by God's eternal Decree. Our Lord could not be hurt in <hi>Herod</hi>'s Juriſdiction, becauſe his laſt Stage was to be <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 13.33.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The means of our Death are diſpoſed and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by God; whether natural, or violent, or caſual means.</hi> Whatſoever it be which brings us to the Grave, 'tis a Meſſenger of his ſending. When the Manſlayer kills another undeſignedly, God is ſaid to deliver the other into his hand, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.13. ſo when bloody Men ſeek after our Lives, 'tis as true that God delivers us into their hands alſo, if we fall into them. <hi>Him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliver'd by the council and foreknowledge of God, you have taken,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. There is no Diſtemper which proves mortal to us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the many that we are incident to, but what therein executes the Orders of God. He who hath appointed ſuch an Event, does like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appoint thoſe things, whereby it is brought about. Diſeaſes in the Body, as well as Storms in the Air, fulfil his Word.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The manner of dying, as to Slowneſs or Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennes, Eaſe or Pain, is directed by the Will of God.</hi> Some are ſnatch'd out of the World, as
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:41523:164"/>
                  <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in haſte, and cut off by a quick ſurprizing ſtroke, like <hi>Sodom</hi>'s overthrow, in a moment: Others have a lingring Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Pins of their Tabernacle are looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and pulled out by degrees. God is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Orderer of both, for he <hi>takes away as he ſees good,</hi> Ezek. 16.50. Some ſlide out of the World, like Rivers of Oil, which run ſmooth and ſoft, without any Bands in their Death; and others die with Agony and Torture, as if the Soul were rent and torn out of the Body, like the caſting of the dumb Spirit out of the Child, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.26. And who knoweth not in all theſe, that the Hand of the Lord hath wrought this?</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>What ſort of Obedience we are to yield to the Will of God in this Caſe?</hi> Here ſhew, what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it, and what are the proper and due Qualifications of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>What is Conſiſtent with this Obedience, which may ſeem oppoſite and repugnant to it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>The uſe of natural Remedies for the preſervation of Life conſiſts very well with our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God in dying, it is the manifeſt Will of God that we ſhould uſe them, when his ſecret will is not to proſper them.</hi> When we know not how he will do with us, we know not what he hath requir'd us to do for our ſelves. A diligent Application of Recovering means, may be accompanied with our dutiful ſubmitting of the iſſue to him. 'Tis no Rebellion againſt the Laws of God to follow the Rules of the Phyſician, even in our laſt Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, before we know whether it will be our laſt or not The Diſtemper'd Body ought not to be neglected, though the departing Spirit is to be
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:41523:165"/>reſign'd. The Body is ſuch an Hand-maid to the Soul, that, it muſt not, like that <hi>Egyptian</hi> Servant, be careleſly left, when it falls ſick, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.31.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conditional Requeſts to God for ſparing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, are not inconſiſtent with this Obedience.</hi> Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Requeſts indeed are not allowable; to ask Life in a peremptory Manner, whether it be the Will of God to grant it to no, is as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as 'tis vain; but to ask it, with a become<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjection to his unknown good Pleaſure, is what he approves, though he denies to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Our Lord himſſelf intreated the paſſing of the Cup from him, <hi>if it were poſſible, or if his Father were willing,</hi> Luke 22.42. So long as there is hope, there is Room for Prayer, yea many Times againſt Hope, Prayer hath prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. While we are under God's Hand, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, but that he may hear; when we find that the unalterable Decree is gone forth; we are to ceaſe, like thoſe Diſciples, when <hi>Paul</hi> would not be perſuaded, ſaying, <hi>The Will of the Lord be done,</hi> Acts 21.14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A zealous purſuit of Holy Deſigns for the Service and Intereſt of Chriſt, to the very laſt, is conſiſtent with our Obedience to the Will of God in dying.</hi> It behoves us to be carrying on Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Projects, as long as we live, though we ſhould yield to dye before we have accompliſht them. Though <hi>David</hi> was told, that he ſhould not have the Honour of building an Houſe for God, yet he continued his vaſt Preparations for it, till the Time that he fell aſleep. While we have any being, we ſhould be aiming at further uſefulneſ, continuing and drawing the Schemes of more good Works, whether God
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:41523:165"/>will give us Opportunity for the performance or not. It will be our Glory to dye with ſuch Work upon our Hands; for no Man ever yet, but Jeſus Chriſt was able to do, all that was in his Heart to do for God, [Mr. <hi>N. Mather.</hi>]</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſtrugglings of Humane Fleſh againſt the bitterneſs of Death, though never altogether Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in us, as in Chriſt, will conſiſt with our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in dying.</hi> Nature cannot receive ſuch a Sentence in it ſelf without ſome Averſion, though Grace overcomes and ſubdues it. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will look upon Death as an Enemy ſtill, though Grace looks upon it as Conquer'd. The Mind ſo far as it is renewed, is entirely given up to God, but the Sanctification of the Spirit Soul and Body being ſtill imperfect, there will be ſome remaining Reluctancies. Theſe, tho' not excuſable from Sin, are nevertheleſs recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with Sincerity. The dying Acts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are not free from guilty weakneſs, and yet are unqueſtionably done in greateſt Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs. There is ſomething which pulls back, but a ſtronger Principle which draws them forward.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What are the due and proper Qualifications of this Obedience?</hi> Anſ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It includes a quiet expecting and waiting for God's Call.</hi> Obedience to God in dying muſt not ſpring from an impatient Diſcontent of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; for then it is no Obedience, but real un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs of the Spirit, ſeeking Deliverance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Time from ſome burdenſome Evils, wherewith we are oppreſt. Perſons under long and great Afflictions, are very apt to ſay, <hi>It is enough now oh Lord, take away my Life,</hi> as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.4. But whatever our Exerciſes
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:41523:166"/>be, it is not enough, till God thinks meet. This is a venting of irregular Paſſion, not an act of Duty. <hi>Rebeckab cries, I am weary of my Life, becauſe of the Daughters of Heath,</hi> Gen. 27. <hi>ult.</hi> But nothing will juſtifie ſuch wearineſs, till our Time to dye is fully come. A diſcharge ſhould be acceptable when God is pleas'd to give it, but not be raſhly ſought out of the appointed Seaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>An humble bearing of God's fatherly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if there ſhould be any Tokens of it upon us in our Death.</hi> We have an hint of this from the very Caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> here, <hi>Chap.</hi> 32.51. <hi>Becauſe you treſpaſſed againſt me among the Children of Iſrael, at the Waters of Meribah-kadeſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſanctified me not in the midst of them.</hi> This one Sin and Miſcarriage of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Conduct of the People, is call'd to remembrance by God, when he is going out of the World; and therefore <hi>as the Lord on whoſe Hand the King of Iſrael leaned, was to ſee the Plenty in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria with his Eyes, but not to Eat thereof,</hi> 2 Kings 7.2. So <hi>Moſes</hi> now was to behold, but not enjoy, the good Things of this pleaſant Land. God had threaten'd to kill him a great many Years before, for neglect of Circumciſion to his Child, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24. And now actually ſummons him to dye, as a Rebuke for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; for indeed this was the Sin that lay at the bottom; <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Becauſe you believed me not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zacharias</hi> was ſtruck Dumb, above nine Months for not believing the Angels Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.20. But <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt loſe his Life. God had once paſs'd by great unbelief in him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.21, 22. But this was not to eſcape without Corection. and yet 'tis born, as from a Father without Complaint.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:41523:166"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A final Farewel to this World, and to thoſe Things particularly, which are apt to render a stay in it most deſirable.</hi> When God calls us forth, we muſt take our leave as Perſons that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to return, as long as the preſent Frame of this World endures. The Places which we now poſſeſs, are to know us no more, and we are to know them no more. Every one at ſuch a Time, may ſay as our Lord did, <hi>Now I am no more in the World,</hi> John 17.11. I muſt rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon my ſelf, as one, that ſhall have nothing more to do with it, as one that is going to be everlaſtingly remov'd at the greateſt diſtance from it, and to be no further concern'd in any thing, which hath the leaſt Reference or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it. Such Thoughts are to govern and influence our Minds, in the Performance of this dying Act of Obedience to God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A quitting and abandoning of this mortal Fleſh, as that which is not to be reaſſum'd, till it puts on Immortality at the Diſſolution of all Things</hi> 'Tis indeed a great Tryal of Obedience, to part with ſuch an old and intimate Companion, which hath been joyn'd and knit by the cloſeſt vital Bands, it may be, for Twenty, Thirty, Forty, or Fifty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Years together; but 'tis a trial which our Obedience muſt be approv'd in. This Body of Fleſh, as it now is, is to be given up as a Sacrifice to the Devourer; that which ſo much Pains and Coſt is beſtow'd upon, which ſo many Creatures are deſtroy'd to ſupport and maintain, is to be Meat for Worms, corrupted and diſpers'd we cannot tell where. Under the Apprehenſions of Death's feeding upon it after it.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:41523:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>A willing Surrender of our Souls into God's hands, from whence they originally came.</hi> Death is expreſt by God's requiring the Soul, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. now, in compliance with this great Demand of God, the Soul is to be yielded up; God commits this Treaſure to us while we live, and he expects a Reſignation of it when we die. But this muſt be with free and full Conſent, or elſe 'tis no Reſignation, and conſequently no Obedience; for that which is forc'd and conſtrain'd, is as none in God's Eſteem. He ſees into the ſecret Springs and Motives of every Act; and that which we do, meerly becauſe we cannot avoid it, will be to him as it were not done; for God's taking away of the Soul, is his Act, only the delivering of it up can be ours. To die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we muſt needs die, becauſe we cannot keep alive our own Souls, and have no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our Spirit, is conſiſtent with the higheſt Diſobedience, and Rebellion againſt God. But when our Wills fall in with the Appointment of God, and we chuſe to die, when God orders that we ſhould, this is truly <hi>to die at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Aaron</hi> did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 33.38. Here is Freedom and Neceſſity going hand in hand; as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Putting off</hi> notes Freedom, and <hi>muſt</hi> notes Neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>An awful and ſerious Preparationto give an account of our ſelves to God.</hi> This is as neceſſary as dying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Every one of us ſhall give Account,</hi> &amp;c. And we cannot die according to the Will of God, without ſome ſuitable Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs for it. There is no true obeying of providential Calls to any Service here in this World, without ſome previous Diſpoſitions in our own Minds wrought by the Grace of God,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:41523:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>for its performance: As when <hi>Paul</hi> was put upon remembring the Poor, he tells us, it was that which he was beforehand <hi>forward to do, Gal.</hi> 2.10. So it is here, as to departing out of the World; we cannot obey God as we ought in it, except we are competently fitted for it. If we die in the Lord, it ſuppoſes that we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to die; and we are not ready, unleſs our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts be ſo.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>A thankful Entertainment of our dying Lot, as a real Privilege.</hi> If we are in every thing to give Thanks, we are to do it in this Caſe, as well as any other. Yea, there is more cauſe for doing it at Death, than at any ſeaſon or time of Life going before it. there is no Act of Obedience which deſerves to be more chearfully performed, than this, nor ſo chearfully as this. It becomes as chriſtian to be glad, when he can find the Grave; to go down into it, not as a Condemned Priſoner, but as one who is a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Conqueror. If there be matter of Joy, when we fall into divers Temptations, how much more when we are going to be freed from all? If we are to Rejoice in the hope of Glory, when fartheſt off, how much more when upon the Borders of Fruition?</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>A vigorous Exerciſe of Faith with reſpect to an unſeen State, when God is leading us forth to it.</hi> All Obedience muſt be the Obedience of Faith, flowing from it, and impregnated with it; Faith is to run through every Duty of our whole Lives, or elſe no Duty would be accepted; but eſpecially we are to die in Faith. And there is great need of our doing ſo; for we have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidence of inviſible future Things, but only our Faith. <hi>thomas, who would not believe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:41523:168"/>what he ſaw,</hi> John 20.25. tells Chriſt, <hi>We know not whither thou goest,</hi> John 14.5. 'Tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an unknown Land, and the way through which we paſs to it is dark and gloomy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the enlightning Diſcoveries of Faith. This alone will clear up all; and ſo it is with every Believer, as with <hi>Abraham, Hebr.</hi> 11.8. <hi>By Faith, when he was called to go out into a place which he ſhould after receive for an Inheritance, obeyed, not knowing whether he went.</hi>

               <p n="3">III. <hi>WHY we ſhould thus die in Obedience to the Will of God?</hi> There are many Reaſons for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God is Supream and Abſolute Lord.</hi> He hath the higheſt Proprietyin us, and the moſt unlimited Dominion over us. <hi>Behold as the clay is in the Potters hand, ſo are you in my hand, O houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 18.6. He forms every Veſſel as he pleaſes, and is at liberty to break his own Workmanſhip without controul; ſo the ſame God whoſe power produces, hath a right to diſſolve our Subſtance. He is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Spirits, and they are his peculiar Off-ſpring, and therefore ought to be entirely at his Command: He created and infuſed them, and on that account may juſtly call for them, whenever he will. 'Tis but like the Stream's going back to its Fountain; <hi>like the Rivers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:41523:169"/>turning to the Sea,</hi> whence they came, and <hi>the Sun's haſting to the place where he aroſe,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.5, 7. We know nothing of God as we ought to know, if we know not this, that God hath a far greater Intereſt in us, than we have in our ſelves: And that it belongs to him, and not to us, to govern and appoint all thoſe things which do concern us. It was almoſt in the ſame breath that <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou art my God, and my times are in thy hand,</hi> Pſalm 31.14, 15. We deſtroy his Deity, if we deny his Sovereignty; we renounce him as our God, unleſs we ſubmit to him as Lord of our Lives. If he may not determine the Period of Life, why ſhould he manage any of the Affairs of it? And if we exclude his Providence, why ſhould we admit his Being?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We have the Character of God's Servants, and profeſs Subjection to him; but we contradict this Character and Profeſſion, except we die in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Will of God.</hi> 'Tis obſerv'd, that <hi>Moſes</hi> is never call'd the Servant of the Lord in all his life time, till now that he came to die; becauſe hereby he did moſt remarkably approve himſelf ſuch, though he had performed many great and excellent Services to God before. He that is another Man's Servant, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be called off from his preſent Work and Station, at his Maſter's pleaſure; they that are under the Yoke, are not to be the Diſpoſers of their own Time; or rather we may ſay, they have no Time which is their own, but what is allowed them. We are under a ſtricter Law to God, and he that calls Himſelf a Chriſtian, does thereby acknowledge it; we are not our own, but the Lords, both living and dying, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:41523:169"/>there is as much reaſon for our dying, as for our living to the Lord, and as little reaſon for our dying, as for our living, to our ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8. It was <hi>Paul</hi>'s earneſt deſire and hope, that <hi>Christ ſhould be magnified in his Body, whether by life, or by death,</hi> Phil. 1.20. And this became him, as <hi>a Servant of Christ,</hi> ver. 1. For we are falſly ſo called, and aſſume a Name which our Pactice does not agree to, if his Will be not a Rule to ours in every thing, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in this grand and important Point of Life and Death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>OUr Lord Christ, when he took upon him the Form and Quality of a Servant, was our Example in this Caſe. He became Obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs,</hi> Phil. 2.8. A Death ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced wih the moſt tremendous Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, as we can never be call'd to be obedient to, yet he did not refuſe or decline it, as he might have done, when his Hour came. His Life was not taken from him, but he laid it down of himſelf, <hi>becauſe he had received ſuch a Commandment of the Father,</hi> John 10.18. It was a free and voluntary Act; he gave up the Ghoſt in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, as is plain from all the Paſſages going before his Death. It was in the proſpect of its near approach, that he ſaid to his, Diſciples, <hi>Ariſe, let us go hence,</hi> John 14.31. The words were ſpoken, where Chriſt had ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated his laſt Supper, but the place which he ſpeaks of removing to, was the Garden, where he knew that he ſhould be betray'd and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Jeſus knowing all things that ſhould come upon him, went forth,</hi> &amp;c. He boldly and chearfully met the Enemy, whom he could eaſily either have ſhun'd, or defeated. He
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:41523:170"/>was able to eſcape this Death, but would not; and therein is a pattern to us, who have no ſuch power.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>God never give a Commiſſion to Death, nor lays his command upon us to die, but when 'tis real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fitteſt Seaſon for us to obey him in it.</hi> To ſpeak ſtrictly, an untimely Death is never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by God; we are never ſuffer'd to die, when it would be better for us to live, Infinite Wiſdom and Grace will not permit it; and he that reſigns himſelf to their Conduct, is ſure to die, when it is beſt that he ſhould. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is expreſs, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 116.15. <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</hi> This may be moſt clearly expounded and underſtood by comparing with <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72.14. (which is a Pſalm for <hi>Solomon,</hi> as Type of Chriſt) <hi>He ſhall redeem their Soul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and precious ſhall their Blood be in his ſight;</hi> ſo precious, that when it is fitter to be ſpar'd than ſpilt, he will certainly preſerve it. Though God can kill or keep alive, as he will, he does not act after an Arbitrary manner; he never turns a Saint to deſtruction, when it would be good for him, that his Soul ſhould be held in Life. We do not indeed ſee the Grounds and Reaſons of God's acting, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Thoughts are not as his Thoughts, but it would be very ſtrange, if we muſt not truſt God further than we yet ſee, becauſe we ſhall ſee hereafter, though not now.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>In our Obedience to this command of God, there is the greateſt reward.</hi> There is a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the doing of every one, but above all in this. There's no Act of Obedience ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to our ſelves as this, if we conſider the Glory, Honour, and Peace which immediately
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:41523:170"/>follows. If a <hi>Servant deſireth the Shadow,</hi> Job 7.2. Why ſhould we be unwilling to enter into our Reſt, and receive our full Reward, when our Work is done? Can we think that our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices would be ſo well recompenc'd by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtay here? 'tis impoſſible to think ſo. When the Maſter is come, and calleth for us, (as <hi>John</hi> 11.28.) we cannot but know, it is in order to our unſpeakable Promotion and Advancement. The Arrows which Death ſhoots, though they kill, yet they are directed and deſign'd in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Love, than <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s to <hi>David,</hi> which were to prevent him from being killed. Death may ſeem formidable at a diſtance (as one ſays) like <hi>Eſau</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> but is very friendly when it comes nigher to us, and does us the kindeſt Office, which to have undone, would be our greateſt loſs. Though it did no more than caſe us of the grievous weight of indwelling Sin, that's a matchleſs Benefit; for if we had not mortal Bodies, we muſt have immortal Corruptions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>This is the concluding and crowning Act of our Obedience to God in this World.</hi> 'Tis the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat finiſhing of our whole Work here; when we have done this we have no more to do on Earth. Now how incongruous, and unſeemly, how reproachful and diſhonourable would it be, for a Man to live many Years in a courſe of Duty, and then ſpoil all by Diſobedience in the laſt Act? Undoubtedly, the Man whoſe Heart is perfect and upright with God, ſhall never be left to do ſo: If we have been truly Faithful to the Death, we ſhall not be Rebellious in it. But however Exhortations and Arguments are of uſe to the beſt, through the efficacious Concurrence of the Spirit with them. He that lives to the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:41523:171"/>Will of God, cannot be ſaid to perſevere finally, unleſs he dies according to that Will alſo. We do not follow God fully, if we ſtart and fly back juſt at the end of our Race, when we ſhould lay hold upon the Prize. <hi>I know thy works, and the last to be more than the first;</hi> was <hi>Thyatiras</hi>'s Commendation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.19. God expects that at the laſt we ſhould outdo all which we have done before. If we have run well, 'tis pity that the laſt ſtep ſhould be the ſloweſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>This being the laſt Act of our Obedience here in this World, will have the greateſt Influence on thoſe whom we leave behind us.</hi> As the laſt words of dying Perſons are apt to make the deepeſt Impreſſion upon ſurviving Friends, ſo their laſt Acts are moſt likely to encourage Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When we forget moſt of the Paſſages of their Lives, we remember their Deaths, and are ready to take our meaſures from thence. And indeed the Holy Ghoſt calls upon us eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>mark the End of the perfect and upright Man,</hi> Pſalm 37.37. and to <hi>conſider the End of their Converſation, whoſe Faith we are to follow,</hi> Hebr. 13.7. <hi>The End</hi> here, ſignifies the cloſe, the iſſue of their Converſation; Now where this is unimitable, it will obſtruct our following of all that went before, how good ſoever it were. This will ſtill ſtick moſt upon their Minds, that ſhould take Pattern from our Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and tend to diſhearten them from walking with God, if after a Life of ſervice we ſhould flinch and faulter in the laſt Extremity; it may tempt ſome to believe, that God is an hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and that we too late begin to think him ſo. Whereas an holy ſubmiſſive Death will have all the contrary Effects.</p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:41523:171"/>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>This is an Act of Obedience, from which God's chiefeſt Favourites on Earth are not exempted.</hi> If this were a Cup which paſſed from every one elſe, and were only filled out to us, it might be more bitter to drink of it and ſinful Fleſh might have the more to ſay againſt it; but God lays no other Burden upon us herein, than what all his Saints, excepting two, have born from the beginning of the World; yea, even thoſe two, underwent a Change in their Tranſlation, in ſome reſpects, we are ſure, equivolent to Death. Are we ſo much better than our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, than the many Thouſands which have gone to Heaven the ſame way, that we ſhould expect any peculiar Privilege? <hi>Are we greater than Abraham, who is dead, and the Prophets, who are dead? whom do we make our ſelves?</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8.53. Does God deal worſe with us, or require more from us, than from all the Excellent of the Earth? Why muſt not we give place to others, when God thinks meet, as others have made way for us, that ſucceſſive Generations may ſtill go and come? That Life which we are prone to complain of, as too ſhort, 'tis probable hath been longer than many; and the ſhorteſt is certainly longer than we deſerve that it ſhould be.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>'Tis an Act wherein God's Saints on Earth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do the Obedience of Angels in Heaven.</hi> This is a mighty Honour to us, that we are capable of honouring God by dying according to his will, which is out of their Power, for they die not. 'Tis their bright and glorious Character, that they do his Commandments, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.20. but this is a command which they cannot do, and which they were never tried with. They have
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:41523:172"/>no ſuch Bodies as we have, to be ſeparated from; and by the Settlement which God hath made, meer ſpiritual Beings cannot taſte of Death. Now this is a thing worthy of our Ambition, to bring more Glory to God than the higheſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel can; for a Saint of God would ſeek to excel all Creatures. 'Tis no Tryal to Angels, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the orders which they receive, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what <hi>Moſes</hi> did here in the Text; and yet 'tis aſtoniſhing to read, how familiarly he hears of his own Departure; there was no noiſe, no ſtriving, no trouble in the caſe; God only ſays to him, <hi>Go up and die,</hi> and he does it; as when the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> had Food ſet before him, and was invited to ariſe and eat; to which an hungry Man in a barren Wilderneſs, would need very little perſwaſion. To which of the Angels did God ſay thus at any time? Our Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality gives us an opportunity of obeying, which they want.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>All the Obedience which we have to yield after this to God in Heaven, will be (like that of the Angels) moſt eaſie and delightful.</hi> Glorified Saints are doing endleſs Service, but there is nothing of Labour or Difficulty in it; nor can there be the leaſt degree of averſion or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to perform it. When we have once poured out our Souls into the Boſom of God, we ſhall launch into the pleaſant Enjoyment of Eternal Praiſe; and ſo far as we underſtand the Worſhip of the Church above, this will be the whole buſineſs, that we ſhall be exerciſed in; A buſineſs which will contribute greatly to our Bleſſedneſs. There is a great deal of weight and force in this Argument, if we think ſeriouſly upon it; how hard and painful ſoever the work
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:41523:172"/>of dying be, all our work afterwards will be entire and perfect; like crowding through a ſtrait Gate into a ſpacious Manſion, where we are to walk at Liberty for ever. How deſirous ſoever the Fleſh is in any of us to be delivered from Death, no Soul can be excuſed from that Work which is conſequent upon it; we could not be ſo happy in Heaven, if we were not ſo employed; as to be kept out of Heaven by an Immortality here, and be moſt miſerable.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. To Apply this. <hi>By way of Information, and Exhortation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Information.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a great Act of Indulgence in God, to ſpare us, as he many times doth from Death; ſince that dying is ſo great and neceſſary an Act of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> If God had let looſe his hand, and cut us off many years ago, it would have been our Duty to acquieſce in it; but by his Favour (as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of his Mountain) our clay Cottages do yet ſtand. How many Mercies, National and Perſonal, have we liv'd to partake of, which we might have been ſent to our Grave without, and as we could not have reſiſted the Will of God, if it had been ſo, ſo we ought not to have repin'd againſt it. In how many leſſer things hath God very often gratified his Servants, by prolonging their Days, wherein he could have denied them, without doing them any wrong? As the Life of old <hi>Jacob</hi> was lengthened out above Twenty years (as ſome compute) after he had given up his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> for dead, to ſee him living and Governor of <hi>Egypt Gen.</hi> 46.30. So <hi>David</hi> ſaw his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> peaceably ſeated on his Throne, before he fell aſſeep, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.48.</p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:41523:173"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If it be our duty to be Obedient to death it ſelf, how much more ſhould we ſubmit to all thoſe Evils, which are previous to death?</hi> We are to <hi>Suffer according to the Will of God</hi> in every thing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 19. Or elſe, how do we, like <hi>David, fulfil all his will? Acts</hi> 13.22. and if in that which is great, ſurely we muſt not ſtick at that which is leſs. I do not only mean Sickneſs and Weakneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the uſual Harbingers of Death, but all thoſe other Troubles and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which we are born to, and which we may naturally expect ſome ſhare of, while we are in this World. He who cannot patiently part with any Comfort of Life, when God takes it away from him, is very ill-diſpoſed to yield up Life it ſelf, at the Call of God. Are we to obey God in dying, and do we not think our ſelves oblig'd to bear theſe Calamities, which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſends upon us while we live? Are we to drink of ſuch a Cup at laſt, and can we think that we do well to be angry, and diſcontented at any thing which befals us in the way? Theſe Things are inconſiſtent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How irregular are the workings of our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with reſpect to thoſe that are fallen aſleep in Christ?</hi> God ſeldom or never removes any of our Friends, eſpecially if publickly uſeful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but that we are ready ſecretly, at leaſt, to wiſh, that they had not died, when they did. We know not how to reſtrain our ſelves from ſuch deſires, and yet in deſiring it we are like <hi>Peter</hi> when he talkt of making Tabernacles on the Mount, who knew not what he ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.33. We do not only wiſh their Infelicity, whom we pretend to love and value, but we make our ſelves Rebels in Heart againſt God,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:41523:173"/>we wiſh in plain terms, that our Wills might have ſtood in oppoſition to his, and that our blind miſtaken Judgments might have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to overturn or alter his Wiſe and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unerring Counſels.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>How bleſſed ſhould their Memories be above all others, who are most eminently Exemplary in the performance of this Duty?</hi> Going out of the World, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, is like the burning of rich and fragrant Spices, which leave a ſweet Perfume behind them. 'Tis obſervable, that God did that to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who died according to his Word, which he never did for any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or ſince, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>And he buried him in a Valley in the Land of Moab,</hi> &amp;c. Though there was none to accompany his Body to the Grave, yet God's peculiar Undertaking for his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Miniſtry of Angels (as may be reaſonably ſuppoſed) was ten thouſand times more Honour to him, than the pompous Funeral of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he was carried with ſo vaſt a Train of Mourners out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 50.9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Labour to learn this Leſſon well, of Obedience to the Divine Will in the Point of Death; and that you may do ſo, take theſe Directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Make death familiar to you by frequent fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts of it.</hi> Thoſe things which ſurprize us moſt, we are uſually leaſt ſubmiſſive to God in; but what we expect and look for, we are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually reconciled to. If we propoſe a long Life to our ſelves, and put away the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Death, we ſhall certainly make our
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:41523:174"/>dying work ſo much the harder. 'Tis neceſſary not only to think that our Change muſt come unavoidably at laſt, but that it may come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a very little time. If we live longer than we think, we ſhall live the better; but if we die ſooner than we think, we ſhall die the worſe. If God hath made <hi>our days</hi> generally <hi>as an hand breadth, Pſalm</hi> 39.5. we ſhould mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them out ſucceſſively by an hairs breadth, that when we are at our utmoſt bounds, we may quietly drop away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Look beyond death, while you are looking for it.</hi> Let not that terminate your Sight, which in it ſelf indeed is a doleful Melancholy Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Conſider the Excellency of the Life to come, which takes place immediately upon the concluſion of this. We ſhall not die for ever (as thoſe words ſhould be rendred, which we read, <hi>ſhall never die, John</hi> 11.26.) though we die once; and there is nothing here ſo amiable and perfect as in that World we are going to. If a view of that <hi>Canaan</hi> ſufficed <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he was never to poſſeſs, how much more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory will the proſpect of that Heaven be, where we are to dwell eternally? the ſeeing of our abſent glorified Redeemer there, will help us in our following of him thither, and does diſtinguiſh us from the common Men of the Earth, <hi>John</hi> 14.19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Look upon all the Enjoyments of this preſent Life with ſuch an holy Contempt and Scorn, as they deſerve.</hi> If we be not dead to theſe things before hand, we ſhall not know how to part with them at Death. If we lay up our Treaſure here, it muſt needs be troubleſom and grievous to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:41523:174"/>renounce and quit it. He that would obey God chearfully in his going hence, muſt not think that any of the things that are here beneath can make him happy; and therefore the Heart ſhould not be ſet upon them. It made <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> willing to go to <hi>Canaan,</hi> that they had no Expectation left in <hi>Padan-aram, Gen.</hi> 31.14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Make haſt with your living work, which God gives you to do, with reference to the ſaving of your own Souls, and the ſerving of your Generation.</hi> A Man muſt be ſtrangely ſtupified, and harden'd in a falſe peace, that can be content to leave the World, before he hath anſwer'd the End, and diſpatch'd the Buſineſs, for which he was born into it. A comfortable Death does not ſuit with a ſlothful and careleſs, an uſeleſs and unprofitable Life. He that hath neglected his Duty to himſelf, or to others in his place, may very well b backward and unwilling to die. <hi>Job</hi> begs that it would pleaſe God to deſtroy him, and crys, <hi>Let him not ſpare, for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One,</hi> chap. 6.9, 10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Clear and State your Accounts every day; ſet them in Order, for their Confuſion will cauſe your Diſtraction, when you come to die.</hi> Seriouſly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and reflect upon your daily Walk and Courſe, and do not leave thoſe Miſcarriages to be budled up in a general Repentance, when they are forgotten; which when they are freſh, you may and ought to be particularly humbled for. The more diligent and exact we are in this caſe, the leſs Advantage will Satan have againſt us. A Man can but (ſcarcely die well (as the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:41523:175"/>Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>being ſcarcely ſaved,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18.) who hath any thing elſe to do when his hour comes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Beware of grieving the Spirit, and clouding your own Comforts.</hi> Though full Aſſurance be not abſolutely neceſſary to the yielding of this Obedience in Death, yet our Obedience muſt needs be very defective, where ſome degrees of Aſſurance, or good hope through Grace are not gotten and maintain'd. 'Tis very hard to reſign, without ſome Evidence that God will receive us; very hard to let go our Temporal Life, when we can lay no hold upon Eternal. therefore the Advice is needful, <hi>Jude</hi> 21. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the Love of God;</hi> do nothing that may tend to prejudice or weaken your ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Live upon the Death of Chriſt, as the only Foundation of your warrantable Truſt.</hi> Though you do walk before God in Truth, you will find the need of ſomething elſe to depend on, for your Title to Glory. Some think that there is a Goſpel Myſtery in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s dying ſhort of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s leading the People into it; <hi>viz.</hi> to intimate to us, That the Works of the Law will bring none to Heaven, but Chriſt by his Blood hath open'd our way to it. He that builds his Hope of Salvation upon any thing which he hath done, muſt either periſh, or pull down all again.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Look up to Heaven for Divine Inſtruction in this great Point.</hi> It was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prayer to God, <hi>ſo teach us to number our days, that we may apply our Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90.12. The numbering of our Days aright, is no Vulgar Arithmetick,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:41523:175"/>nor can we learn it without a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tutor. No Man ever died like <hi>Moſes</hi> here, according to the Word of the Lord, but what was taught of God to do it. He that gives out the Command, muſt guide our Spirits to obey it. If we can do nothing for God of our ſelves, leaſt of all can we die to him without him.</p>

               <p>THE Glorious Office of the Prieſthood of Jeſus Chriſt, is the Subject of great part of this Epiſtle; and the Apoſtle's main Scope and Deſign, is, to ſhew the ſuperlative Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency thereof beyond the Legal Prieſthood, which he does at large in various reſpects. In the two immediate foregoing Verſes, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares Chriſt with the Prieſts under the Law, in reference to their Mortality. <hi>Verſe</hi> 23. <hi>They truly were many Prieſts</hi> (many, one after another) <hi>becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue, by reaſon of death;</hi> they were dying Men, and how well ſoever they diſcharged the Duty of their Places,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:41523:176"/>yet in a few Years they left it to thoſe that ſurvived them, and knew it no more themſelves; the Miniſters of the Old Teſtament had their appointed time, when their Breath went forth, and returned not again, as you find that the Miniſters of the New Teſtament have now in their Generation. <hi>But,</hi> ver. 24. <hi>this man,</hi> (or this Chriſt, the Anointed of the Lord, whom the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, for the word <hi>Man</hi> is not in the Original, but ſupplied by our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators) <hi>becauſe he continueth ever, hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable Prieſthood;</hi> his Office does not paſs from him to another, he hath no Succeſſors in it, whom the Exerciſe of it is committed to, but he ſtill manages it in his own Perſon, and will perpetually do it. Hereupon that comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and encouraging Inference and Concluſion is drawn up in the words of the Text, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is able,</hi> &amp;c. Whcih words, if they were to be caſt into our uſual Forms of Argument, would run thus; <hi>He who ever lives to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, is able to ſave to the uttermost; But Jeſus Chriſt ever lives,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore he is able,</hi> &amp;c. There are many important Truths lying in this Text, but all may be brought within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of this one.</p>
               <p>Obſerv. <hi>Chriſt's eternal Life and Interceſſion in Heaven, in an infallible Proof of his Infinite ſaving Power.</hi> Here,
<list>
                     <item>I. I ſhall enquire into the Thing which the Apoſtle undertakes to prove, The infinite-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-Power of Jeſus Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>II. Into the Evidence which he proves it by, The Eternal Life and Interceſſion of Chriſt in
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:41523:177"/>Heaven. With the diſtinct Uſes which may be made of both theſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>As to the thing which the Apoſtle here ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to prove,</hi> viz. <hi>The infinite-ſaving Power of our Lord Jeſus.</hi> The Text it ſelf will lead us to the opening of two Things under this Head; The nature of this Power, and the extent of it; How he is able to ſave, and how far, even to the uttermoſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>With reference to the nature of this Power, How is Chriſt</hi> able <hi>to ſave?</hi> This may may be ſtated in the following Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a Power which belongs to Christ, as he is God.</hi> In this, as in all other Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, the Second Perſon is equal with the Firſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8. <hi>I am the Almighty.</hi> The very ſame unlimited boundleſs Power appertains both to the Father and the Son. Therefore when Chriſt had aſſerted, That <hi>none ſhould pluck his ſheep out of his hand,</hi> John 10.28. he confirms it by this, <hi>That his Father is greater than all, and none is able to pluck them out of the Father's hand, ver.</hi> 29. Now if any ſhould go about to deny the Conſequence, the next words will clear it, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> ver. 30. If my <hi>Father is greater than all,</hi> ſo am I; if he be <hi>able</hi> to ſecure and preſerve the Sheep, ſo am I, for he and I are one; we are one in Eſſence and Nature, and ſo all the ſame glorious Perfections which are inherent in him, are in me likewiſe. But this, though it be a great Article of Faith, and a great ſupport to Believers, does not ſeem to be that which the Apoſtle hath ſo much an Eye to in this place; for he is now ſpeaking of his Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſave, under the Notion of our High-Prieſt.</p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:41523:177"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a given delegated Power, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Chriſt as he is Mediator; a Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and entruſted with him, from the Father.</hi> God's laying of help upon him for us, implies the furniſhing and qualifying of him to afford and diſpenſe that help to us. So we read, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.21. <hi>With whom my hand ſhall be eſtabliſhed, mine arm alſo ſhall ſtrengthen him.</hi> Again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Behold, my Servant, whom I uphold,</hi> &amp;c. There was ſuch a mighty Preſence and Influence of God with and upon his Son Jeſus Chriſt, in the Execution of his Mediatory Office, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled and empower'd him to all that this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice required. Therefore he attributes the Work which he did to the Father, and calls them <hi>the Works of the Father, John</hi> 10.37. and argues from them, as plain convincing Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that <hi>the Father had ſent him,</hi> chap. 5.36. The Power which he had from God to do ſuch things, was a demonſtration of his Commiſſion. The Son of himſelf, conſider'd in this Capacity, as the Father's Servant and Meſſenger, diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Heaven, about the great Buſineſs of our Salvation, <hi>could do nothing, ver.</hi> 19. but his God was his ſtrength; he that appointed him this Service, gave him Ability to perform it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This Power of Christ is determined by the Father's Pleaſure. It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. <hi>All Fulneſs,</hi> therefore a Fulneſs of Power, as well as Merit; but we muſt ſuppoſe it to be all exerted and put forth, as is pleaſing to the Father alſo. The Power given unto Chriſt, can never be thought to be employed by Chriſt againſt the Mind and Will of him that gave it. God and Chriſt go hand in hand (as it were) in all their mighty
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:41523:178"/>Acts of Grace, with one conſenting Will. <hi>John</hi> 5.21. <hi>As the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even ſo the Son quickeneth whom he will;</hi> not in oppoſition to the Father's Will, but in conjunction with it. <hi>He came not to do his own will, but his that ſent him,</hi> chap. 6.38. It was his delight to do this, and impoſſible that he ſhould do any thing contrary to it. This does not import any inſufficiency or weakneſs in Chriſt, but the regularity and exactneſs of his Obedience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt's ſaving Power with reſpect to us, takes in his Sovereignty and Dominion over all Creatures, which is for our Advantage.</hi> We have the benefit of his univerſal governing Power, in order to our Salvation. He that is exalted to be our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, is a mighty Prince, whoſe Kingdom reaches ever where, to every thing that he hath made. He that carries his Lambs in his Boſom, hath all the things in the world put under his Feet; he hath all the Wolves that would tear and deſtroy them, in a Chain, and they cannot touch ſo much as the Fleece of any of his Sheep, without his permiſſion. <hi>All power is given unto him in Heaven and in Earth</hi> (yea, and in Hell too) <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>He hath power over all fleſh, John</hi> 17.2. whether Devils and wicked malignant Spirits, over all that ſeek our burt, or that give us any cauſe of Terror. He hath a Command over all Creatures, that diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of all Events, and he can make every one of theſe, not only not to hinder and obſtruct, but poſitively to promote and further our Salvation. The whole Adminiſtration of the Affairs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which is committed to Chriſt, ſerves to this very purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:41523:178"/>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The ſaving power of Christ, to all that have experience of it, does neceſſarily include a great and extraordinary mixture of Compaſſion.</hi> We muſt conclude his Pity equal to his Power, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, or elſe no Soul would ever be ſaved by it. His infinite Ability to relieve us, would be of ſmall Comfort to us, if he were not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a feeling of our Infirmities. We have an hint of this, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.18. <hi>He is able to ſuccour them that are tempted,</hi> (the ſame Greek word both there and in the Text.) Now 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from the Context there, that Chriſt's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>able to ſuccour,</hi> implies not barely a Power, but a fitneſs and readineſs to do it, a compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Inclination, by reaſon of his being tempted. Now though Chriſt be no longer ſo tempted, for <hi>he ſits on the right hand of the power of God, Luke</hi> 22.69. yet his Bowels are the ſame. If he wanted thoſe Bowels, his Power would be dreadful; we could only look upon him as our Deſtroyer, <hi>able</hi> to caſt us Soul and Body into Hell, <hi>able</hi> to inflict Wrath upon us to the uttermoſt; but we could have no thoughts of Peace, or hopes of Mercy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>There is a deſtructive Power of Chriſt, which always does and muſt accompany this ſaving Power.</hi> In magnifying his ſaving Power to us, there is a neceſſity of letting out his deſtructive Power againſt our Enemies. If he ſaves our Lives and ranſoms them, what follows? <hi>O Death, I will be thy Plague; O Grave, I will be thy Deſtruction, Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. We cannot be delivered from Death, but Death muſt be unſtung, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deſtroy'd. This is the laſt Enemy, but all the reſt are dealt with in like manner, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.14. <hi>That through death he might deſtroy
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:41523:179"/>him, who had the power of death, i. e.</hi> the Devil. The choſen and called of God cannot eſcape, if the Devil do; if they obtain Salvation in Chriſt, he muſt be deſtroy'd; not as to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but his Power. And the Works of the Devil muſt be deſtroyed alſo, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>There muſt not remain ſo much as one of them;</hi> as is ſaid of that total overthrow of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> when the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God were ſaved out of their hands, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.28.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>With reference to the extent of this Power, How far is Chriſt able to ſave?</hi> The Text makes the Anſwer, even <hi>to the uttermost.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There are two things intimated by this Phraſe, The Perfection of that Salvation which Chriſt is able to work, and the duration of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His being able to ſave to the uttermoſt, notes Perfection.</hi> He is <hi>able to ſave</hi> fully, abſolutely, and compleatly; ſo that nothing more needs, or can be done. Chriſt without us, and Chriſt in us, does all that belongs to this work of our Salvation. He gives a right to Salvation, and a meetneſs for Salvation: He juſtifies perfectly, he Sanctifies wholly; what the Law could not do, that he as the End of the Law (not a deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a perfecting End) hath done. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He ſaves from all Sin;</hi> or elſe that indefinite expreſſion could hardly be ſav'd from an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, which the Spirit of Truth abhors: <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>He ſhall ſave his People from their Sins,</hi> i. e. from all their Sins, not one excepted (for as to the unpardonable Sin, he ſaves his People from that preventively, becauſe none of them ſhall ever be ſuffer'd to commit it.) He
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:41523:179"/>is able to ſave from the greateſt Sins, as from the leaſt; from Sins of the blackeſt Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the deepeſt die. He ſaved our firſt Parents from their firſt Sin, which being a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Act of Rebellion, was a very great one. He ſav'd ſeveral of his Murderers, and they that ſhed his Blood were waſh'd in it. He ſaves from the Sin of Unbelief, which is the worſt of Sins, and in thoſe that are guilty of it now, is really greater than the Sin of the <hi>Jews</hi> in putting him to death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He ſaves from all that is in Sin; from the guilt and filth of it.</hi> He takes out every ſpot from the Soul, and wipes out every Line from the Score. He pays the uttermoſt Farthing, and therefore ſaves to the uttermoſt; he diſcharges all, and leaves nothing to ſtand in God's Book againſt us. His whole Church ſhall be preſented Holy, <hi>and without blemiſh, Epheſs.</hi> 5.27. No Corruption is ſuffer'd to domineer, where he comes to ſave; as <hi>Job</hi> enters his ſolemn Proteſtation, <hi>That no blot cleaves to his hands, chap.</hi> 31.7. Blots may be, and unavoidably will be contracted, while we are in ſuch a polluting World, but they with whom Chriſt hath any thing to do, ſoon ſhake them off again, as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Viper which faſtned on his hand, <hi>and felt no barm,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 28.5.) Yea at length, Chriſt will ſave from the in being of Sin too; when we quit our earthly Houſes, Sin ſhall be quite turn'd out of Doors.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He ſaves from all that's due to Sin, and from all the effects of it;</hi> from Wrath preſent and to come; not meerly from Hell, but from all purely Judicial Strokes upon Earth too; He does not ſave from God's loving Rebukes, (for that would
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:41523:180"/>be to our prejudice, and therefore it would be no proper, deſirable Salvation) but from God's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Rebukes he does. <hi>He hath Redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. from the whole Curſe, and every part of it. There is not the leaſt Grain of the Legal Curſe in all the afflictions which Chriſt's ſaved ones do at any time undergo. There are <hi>chaſtened as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> not perſecuted as common Malefactors. They are ſav'd from every thing that would make them truly miſerable; they are exercis'd with nothing but what ſhall do them good; thoſe very Calamities, of which Sin is the occaſion, ſhall be the means to advance their Bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His being able to ſave to the uttermoſt, notes duration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As 1. <hi>The ſaving Power of Chriſt ſtretches it ſelf to the final Accompliſhment of his own Work;</hi> Whatever He puts his hand unto, he will give it his laſt hand; <hi>the Author and Fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher of our Faith, Heb.</hi> 12.2. Whereſoever he Deſigns to build, it ſhall not be ſaid, that he is not <hi>able to finiſh;</hi> he will give no occaſion for any ſuch Reproach to be caſt upon his Eternal Power. He is as able to bring forth the Head-Stone, as to lay the firſt Foundation. He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on his Deſigns of Grace through all Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances and Oppoſitions, till he hath conquer'd and ſurmounted all; he never leaves off what he undertakes, and is engag'd in, before the <hi>thoughts of his heart</hi> are finally perform'd, and all fulfilled which he had contriv'd and purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do. He is the <hi>Omega</hi> as well as the <hi>Alpha;</hi> he <hi>ſhuts up,</hi> as well as <hi>opens,</hi> the great work of a Sinners Salvation and Recovery.</p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:41523:180"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt's ſaving Power will not be exhauſted or diminiſhed to the end of the World.</hi> He will be as able to ſave then, as he was at the beginning; for if he was inveſted with ſuch a Power before he had actually paid the Price of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we have no reaſon to doubt the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Power afterwards. If he had ſav'd ſo many for about Four Thouſand Years before he came and offer'd up himſelf, 'tis impoſſible that ſince this Sacrifice, any ſhould be born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World too late for him to ſave. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſucceſſive Generation yet to come may have the ſame benefit, as all that are paſt have had. So long as the World ſtands, the Elect of God that are in it ſhall receive as freely from Chriſt's Fulneſs as ever any did. His Power is the ſame, without any Change or Variation in all Ages, <hi>Yeſterday, to day and to Morrow; Is my band ſhortned at all that it cannot redeem?</hi> Iſa. 50.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>His Power is ſufficient for us in our greateſt Extremities, while we live in this World.</hi> In our ſoreſt Temptations, and longeſt Deſertions, when like <hi>Peter, we are ready to ſink,</hi> he is <hi>mighty to ſave</hi> ſtill. We cannot be brought ſo low by Helliſh Rage, and ſpiritual Darkneſs, by the Buffetings of Satan, and the Hidings of God, but that he can lift us up. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who have been <hi>broken off by unbelief,</hi> and abode in that <hi>unbelief</hi> ſo many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, God is able to <hi>graft them in again, Rom.</hi> 11.23. When we are apt to think, that there is <hi>no way to eſcape,</hi> that we muſt and ſhall, without remedy, periſh at the laſt, he hath his Almighty Succors at hand, and can in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſcue and deliver us from all our fears. When the <hi>Waters are come into the Soul,</hi> he hath
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:41523:181"/>power to ſave from Drowning; or elſe that Prayer was vain, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69.1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>His ſaving Power is our preſent help when we come to die and ſtand in Judgment.</hi> When we have paſt through the Changes, Hazards, and Tryals of this Life, the chiefeſt of all is that which puts a period to Life, and then Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is able to ſave us in Death, tho he do not ſave us from it; able not only to carry us to our <hi>hoary hairs,</hi> but to go with us far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when theſe <hi>hoary hairs are brought down to the grave;</hi> able to ſupport us when <hi>fleſh and heart,</hi> when <hi>ſtrength and ſpirits fail;</hi> able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and defend our Spirits at their Departure out of the Body, and give them immediate poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the place <hi>prepared for them;</hi> able to anſwer for us before the Bar of God, and ſhield us under the covering of his perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from all the Accuſations that can be brought againſt us; in ſhort, he is ſo well able to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us, that even in that day, we may boldly ſay, <hi>Who is he that condemneth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Salvation which Chriſt works and diſplays his power in, endures in its full force and vertue to Eternity it ſelf.</hi> Iſa. 45.17. <hi>Iſrael ſhall be ſaved in the Lord with an everlaſting ſalvation: You ſhall not be aſhamed nor confounded World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</hi> Again, chap. 57.6. <hi>The Heavens ſhall vaniſh away like ſmoak, and the Farth wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein die in like manner, but my ſalvation ſhall be for ever,</hi> &amp;c. As our Confidence is not in a God who <hi>cannot ſave,</hi> or who can ſave only in part, ſo not in a God who can ſave only for a limited time, or reſtrained ſeaſon. Our God's Salvation laſts as long as himſelf, it runs parallel with his very
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:41523:181"/>Being. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.13. <hi>The great God and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thoſe Two Glorious Titles are chained together in Chriſt, and you may as well ſuppoſe the aboliſhing of the former, as the expiring of the latter: He is an eternal Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as well as Eternal God. Thus <hi>he ſaves to the utternmoſt.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us ſettle our hearts in the faith of this grand Point, againſt the aſſaults of Infidelity in general.</hi> Whatever vile, blaſphemous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable Thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the World have, <hi>to them that are ſaved he is</hi> (and ought to be eſteemed as) <hi>the power of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. There are <hi>Children of Belial</hi> now, as there were in the days of <hi>Saul,</hi> and worſe than they, who cry, <hi>How ſhall this man ſave us?</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.27. Making little more of him than a common, ordinary Son of Man; but to us he ſhould be no leſs than <hi>the Mighty God;</hi> we ſhould reſpect and honour him as ſuch, and thereby do what we can to ballance the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt which is thrown upon him by a wretched Generation that know him not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us improve this for the ſtrengthening of our adherence to Chriſt, and dependance on him, notwithſtanding all that tends to deter and beat us off.</hi> Never give up this Cauſe, never caſt away thy Confidence, but hold faſt the <hi>beginnings of it ſteady to the end,</hi> ſeeing that Jeſus Chriſt can <hi>ſave to the uttermoſt.</hi> There can be no Lion in any part of the way, between thee and Heaven, but what he hath a ſufficiency of Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver and reſcue thee from. <hi>Look as far as thou
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:41523:182"/>canst</hi> (ſays one well) <hi>take the largeſt proſpect that's poſſible, of all thy Sins, Miſeries and Difficulties of Salvation, ſtill the Power of Christ does extend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond all theſe.</hi> We may ſafely ſay, <hi>If Christ be not able to ſuccour and help us, we are content to periſh;</hi> if we reſt there, we are out of danger.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us oppoſe the ſaving ſtrength of Christ to all the united force of Hell.</hi> The Perſecutors of our Souls are indeed ſtronger than we, but they are weaker than he. We have a Friend in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that can do more for us, than all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies from beneath can do againſt us. Thoſe Horns are not ſo able to ſcatter God's <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as this <hi>Horn of Salvation</hi> is to defend them. If evil Angels be greater in power than the beſt of Men left to themſelves, they are not ſo great in power as our great High-Prieſt, <hi>Jeſus the Son of God.</hi> When they have done their utmoſt to ſeparate a Believer from the love of God, 'tis not ſo much as our bleſſed Lord hath done to keep us in it. <hi>Behold, I give unto you power to tread on Serpents and Scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 10.19.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Let this comfort us under the ſenſe of our own impotency.</hi> When we conſider how weak and feeble we are, it is cauſe of deep abaſement; when we conſider how powerful Chriſt is, it is on the other hand matter of <hi>ſtrong conſolation.</hi> There is a kind of Omnipotency communicated from Chriſt to thoſe that are in him: <hi>I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me, Phil.</hi> 4.13. Though we are but <hi>as reeds ſhaken with the wind,</hi> he can make us <hi>Pillars in the Temple of his God, Rev.</hi> 3.12. All that are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>ſure Foundation,</hi> receive ſtability from it.
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:41523:182"/>Therefore as <hi>Abraham</hi> conſidered not the <hi>deadneſs</hi> of his own Body, or <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Womb, being fully perſwaded of God's being able to perform his Promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19, 21. So the belief of Chriſt's Almightineſs ſhould be mixt with the thoughts of our own infirmities.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Let this relieve and fortifie our ſpirits againſt the dejecting fears of our future Apoſtacy.</hi> How little Grace ſoever we yet have, we ſhall have as much as we need, if we belong to Chriſt; for he is able to make <hi>all Grace abound towards us, nd in us.</hi> How defective ſoever our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication yet be, Chriſt hath a Stock enough in his own hands to <hi>fill up what is behind,</hi> that there ſhall be nothing lacking at the laſt. We ſtagger and reel, and ſtumble ſo often, that we are afraid perhaps, we ſhall never hold on, and hold out, till we come to our Journeys end: But ought not this to bear up our hopes, that we are intereſted in one who is able to keep us from falling? <hi>Jude</hi> 24. able to prevent every Fall, or able to recover and raiſe us up when fallen?</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>When we come to the Throne of Grace, this Doctrine will furniſh us with a good plea to urge to God,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Glory of Christ's Power is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqu'd with our Salvation.</hi> It was ſuch a ſort of Argument which <hi>Moſes</hi> went to God with, when God threatned to deſtroy <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he tells him what the Nations would be apt to ſay, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Becauſe the Lord was not able to bring this People into the Land, which he ſware unto them, therefore he hath ſlain them in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</hi> So may we ſay, Lord it will teach the Devil to blaſpheme thy Son, if we ſhould come ſhort of the Reſt which thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:41523:183"/>us; the Powers of Darkneſs which have heard his Fame, and felt his hand, will be ready to vilifie him, and cry, Becauſe he was not able to ſave them he hath ſuffer'd them to periſh.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>This may encourage thoſe that are yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, to come to him;</hi> You are not, you cannot be ſo great Sinners, but that he is ſtill a greater Saviour. Do not miſtake it for your Duty, to aggravate your own Sin, to the leſſening of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi> Though Chriſt is able to ſave me, he may not be willing, and then what am I the better? He is certainly able to do many things which he never does; and ſo I may be loſt, notwithſtanding his ſaving Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. It will do well, if thou art throughly got over this Block of ſuſpecting and diſtruſting the Power of Chriſt: We are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally prone to ſtick here, as the Father of the Child, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.22. <hi>If thou canst do any thing, have compaſſion on us and help us.</hi> Therefore our Lord was wont to put the Queſtion, as to the Blind Man, Mat. 9.21. <hi>Believe you that I am able to do this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is no more doubt of the willingneſs of Chriſt to ſave, than of his power, where he makes the Soul willing to accept of Salvation by him.</hi> When ſuch a conſenting Will is wrought in us, 'tis an infallible evidence of his ſaving Good Will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. What was he given of God for, what did he give himſelf for, but that <hi>whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him ſhould not periſh?</hi> How then canſt thou think that Salvation is his <hi>ſtrange work,</hi> or that he is unwilling to it?</p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:41523:183"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thou canſt not die in thy Sins, if thou wilt come to Chriſt to ſave thee from them.</hi> 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any thing ſhould hinder him from doing this mighty Work upon thee; if thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief do not, nothing will tie his Hands, but only that; He never is as a mighty Man that cannot ſave, but where his mighty Salvation is call'd in Queſtion. Therefore imitate their Faith, who were threatned with the burning Furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Our God is able to deliver us, and he will deliver us.</hi> Be ſatisfied that he who is able to ſave, will actually ſave thoſe that caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon him.</p>

               <p n="2">II. <hi>AS to the Evidence which the Apoſtle brings to prove his Aſſertion by; The Eternal Life and Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven.</hi> Here we are to conſider three Things, <hi>viz.</hi> The Life of Chriſt in Heaven; His Interceſſion there; And the Objects of it, or Perſons on whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half he lives and intercedes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The eternal Life of Chriſt in Heaven.</hi> In opening of this, we ſhould ſhew, That he lives, and that he lives for ever, and how the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his being able to ſave, is built and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereupon.</p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:41523:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Chriſt lives;</hi> not only as he is <hi>the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, Hebr.</hi> 3.12. and ſo eternal Life is eſſential to his Deity, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.2, 15, 20. but he lives as Mediator, and that very Life which he laid down as Man, he hath taken up again, and poſſeſſes it now more advantagiouſly than before. This was the grand Controverſie in the Apoſtolical Times, between the <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians; ſo <hi>Feſtus</hi> repreſents it to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> as a Quarrel about <hi>one Jeſus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive, Acts</hi> 25.19. The <hi>Jews</hi> would have him to be really in the State of the Dead ſtill, and that his Diſciples ſtole him out of the Grave, to give Reputation to their new Doctrine, but the Apoſtles were Witneſſes of his Reſurrection, and preached this where-ever they preach'd the Goſpel; for indeed the whole Goſpel would be but an empty Fable without it. If Chriſt were not alive, what's become of the Type of the Living Bird; in the cleanſing of the Leper, that was let looſe into the open Field? <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.7. What's become of the Type of the Scape Goat that was ſent away into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.21. How have theſe things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Accompliſhment, but in the Life of Jeſus? It was as neceſſary for our Conſolation and Salvation that Chriſt ſhould live, as that he ſhould die. The meer Death of Chriſt would profit us nothing; could be no ſupport to us, if he had continued under the Power of Death. Therefore, as old <hi>Jacob</hi> was tranſported with Joy, when he heard that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.26, 28. So <hi>Job</hi> in the midſt of his Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, triumph'd and glorifie in this, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> Job 19.25.</p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:41523:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That he ever lives.</hi> When our Lord ſpeaks of his Death, it was matter of ſtumbling to the <hi>Jews, becauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we have heard out of the Law, that Chriſt abideth for ever,</hi> John 12.34. but they erred, not knowing the Scripture. This was not be underſtood in oppoſition to his dying, but as conſequent upon it; for after his Death, and notwithſtanding his Death, this was to be made good, that he ſhould abide for ever. So we find our Lord himſelf from Heaven expounding it to <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1.18. <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore.</hi> The Life which Chriſt lived upon Earth, was a mortal, temporary, periſhing Life, as ours is, (for he took part of our Fleſh and Blood in the ſame poor and miſerable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as we do) but the Life which he now lives in Heaven, is of another ſort, of a more permanent and durable Nature. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Knowing that Chriſt being raiſed from the dead di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more; Death hath no more Dominion over him.</hi> He cannot die a ſecond time, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> did, who after his firſt Death was raiſed again, and died again; as the Body of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even when dead, ſaw no Corruption, ſo his glorified Body, with which he ſits at the Right Hand of God, can never ſee Death. His preſent Life is ſuch an one, as ſwallows up mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How is the Inference of Chriſt's being able to ſave, grounded here upon his Living for ever?</hi> Anſwer, Very ſtrongly; for the ſaving Power of Jeſus Chriſt ſhines forth moſt illuſtriouſly in him as living. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Being reconciled by his Death, we ſhall be much more ſaved by his Life.</hi> So Chap. 8. 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:41523:185"/>Chriſt that died, yea</hi> rather <hi>that is raiſed again,</hi> &amp;c. If Chriſt had been held by the Bands of Death, or if it had been poſſible for him ſo to be held, it had been impoſſible for him to be the Author of Salvation to any; our Faith in him had been vain, and our hope as a Spiders Web; whereas now 'tis firm and eſtabliſh'd, ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, conſidering that Jeſus Chriſt ſince his ignominious accurſed Death, is raiſed up to ſuch a Bleſſed and Glorious Life. This gives us mighty encouragement in ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If Chriſt had not been able to ſave, he could not have conquer'd Death, as he hath done.</hi> This one Victory which he hath obtained over that Enemy, is a ſignal demonſtration of his Power; The Grave would have detained him, and muſt kept him as the legal Executioner of Juſtice, if he had not finiſh'd the Work of our Salvation (as to the purchaſing part) and done all in dying once. He could not be diſcharged, till he had anſwer'd all Demands, and when they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, he could be under Arreſt no longer, but the Proſecution muſt ceaſe. When the Debt was paid, it would have been falſe Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for Jeſus Chriſt to remain in the Cuſtody of Death; on the other hand, his reviving and breaking looſe from thoſe Reſtraints, ſhews, that all the Obſtacles of our Salvation are taken out of the way. Therefore, if we ſuſpect his Ability to ſave, we muſt, with the <hi>Jews,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe his riſing again, and look upon him no otherwiſe than as a dead Man to this very day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Our eternal Life is inſeperably connected with the Life of Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis as certain that he is our
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:41523:186"/>Life, as that he himſelf lives, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. he will not Live and Reign without us, but we ſhall Reign in Life by him. He does not live meerly for himſelf, but for us, as he did not die for himſelf, but only for us. He lives as a publick Perſon, a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him ſhall be made alive; as a quickning Head to his whole Body, and to every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in particular, <hi>John</hi> 14.19. <hi>Becauſe I live, you ſhall live alſo.</hi> He aſſerts our Life in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his own; for his Life and the Life of thoſe that are united with him, cannot be divided. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. <hi>He though Crucified through weakneſs, lives by the Power of God; ſo we likewiſe, though weak, ſhall live with him by vertue of the ſame Power.</hi> Hence it is that the Apoſtle makes the great Doctrine of Chriſt's; Reſurrection to ſtand or fall, with the Reſurrection of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.15, 16. <hi>Whom God raiſed not up, if ſo be that the dead riſe not; for if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed.</hi> Either he that quickned our Lord's natural Body, will quicken our mortal Bodies alſo, or we muſt renounce the Faith of both together.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Interceſſion of Chriſt in Heaven.</hi> In handling this, we ſhould enquire what is meant by this Interceſſion; How he lives to this end; how he ever lives in order to it; and wherein his infinite Ability to ſave is evidenc'd hereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What is meant by the</hi> Interceſſion <hi>which Chriſt makesin Heaven.</hi> That it differs from the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Supplications which he offer'd up in the days of his Fleſh, upon the account of the differing Circumſtances of his now Glorious State, which we muſt underſtand it ſuitably to,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:41523:186"/>is (I think) without all Controverſie; That all Interceſſion carries in it in general ſomething of the true nature of Prayer, ſeems alſo clear, whether it be managed with or without the uſe of words, is a diſputed Point. And therefore I ſhall ſum up all that needs to be ſpoken to it, in theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He appears in the Preſence of God for us, Hebr.</hi> 9.24. He repreſents our Perſons there, preſents himelf in our ſtead, and on our behalf, <hi>As Aaron bore the Names of the Children of Iſrael in the breaſt-plate of Judgment upon his Heart, when he went into the Holy Place,</hi> Exod, 28.29. And perhaps in Alluſion to this, Chriſt's ſpeaks of <hi>confeſſing the names of thoſe that overcome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father,</hi> Rev. 3.5. When no one could undertake ſuch a deſperate Cauſe as ours was, he interpoſes and ſtands forth to be our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; when we did not dare to ſhew our ſelves before the Throne God, he acts in the place of poor and miſerable Clients, and makes it his Buſineſs to ſue and ſollicite for them in that aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Court of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He expreſſes his Will and Deſire, that we ſhould partake of all that he hath procured for us.</hi> So far his Interceſſion above agrees with that Prayer which he made, while he was here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they whom thou haſt given me, be with me, where I am, that they may behold my Glory,</hi> &amp;c. And he who knows what is the mind of the Spirit, interceding in us, does very well know the mind of Chriſt, in his making Interceſſion for us. The Father knows not only what we want, but what his Son would have for us. In what way or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Jeſus Chriſt ſignifies his Deſires to any ſuch
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:41523:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>purpoſe, we cannot be eaſily ſatisifed, but that the Deſires of Jeſus Chriſt are all really before God, and regarded by him, we may be very ſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He inſiſts upon his own Blood as a moving Plea.</hi> As the High-Prieſt under the Law was to carry the Blood of the Sacrifice within the Vail, and ſprinkle it upon and before the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Seat, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.14, 15. So the Blood of Chriſt, does not like the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> cry from the Ground, but ſpeaks in Heaven, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.24. And 'tis ſtiled the Blood of ſprinkling there, as being effectually pleaded by him that ſhed it, and the Fruits of it demanded to be beſtow'd upon thoſe whom it was ſhed for. Whatſoever needs to be requeſted for us, our Lord Jeſus does juſtly require as due to himſelf. Our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities cannot go ſo far, but that his Merits extend ſtill further; and upon all occaſions it may be perfectly and fitly urg'd by him (though by none elſe) <hi>Father, I am worthy for whom thou ſhouldſt do this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly, How Chriſt lives to this End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimately; Chriſt lives to God,</hi> Rom. 6.10. <hi>His Exaltation iſſues and centers in the Glory of God the Father,</hi> Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. This was the chief hope and aim of the Life of Chriſt, while he dwelt among us here below, and ſo it is of the Life which he now lives in the World above. And therefore it muſt ſtill be ſuppoſed, that whatever other Deſigns he is engaged in the purſuit of, they are all ſubordinate to this. The honouring of the Father is more to Chriſt, than the Happineſs of any Creature whatſoever, tho' they may very conſiſtently be carried on both at once.</p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:41523:187"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis undeniable that Jeſus Chriſt does not live for this end only, in Subordination to the Glory of God; but for other purpoſes beſides, which have all a reference and tendency to that laſt end.</hi> He lives to execute his Prophetical Office ſtill; for by his Spirit whom he ſheds forth, he leads both his Miniſters and all Believers into all Truth, and ſo declares and manifeſts the Counſel of God moſt effectually to this very day. He lives to execute his Kingly Office ſtill, in the Holy Government of his Church, and further ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Enemies; <hi>for he muſt reign, till he hath put all under his Feet,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.25. <hi>And he is to ſit upon his Throne of his Glory,</hi> as Univerſal Judge at the Great Day, <hi>when all Nations ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered before him,</hi> and Sentenc'd by him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31, 32.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The making of Interceſſion is a very eminent and conſiderable Act, which Chriſt lives in order to, though it be not his ultimate or only end of living.</hi> I ſay, a very eminent and conſiderable Act; for Interceſſion is a ſpecial part of Chriſt's Prieſtly Office; the Prieſthood of Jeſus Chriſt did not expire at his Death, but after Death, when he lived again, he was to tranſact and negotiate our Affairs with God. This is the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Text, which is abuſed and pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> to countenance their falſe Principles, that Jeſus Chriſt was not a Prieſt, till he came to Heaven, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.4. <hi>If he were on Earth he ſhould be a Prieſt.</hi> The plain ſenſe and import of which Paſſage is this, That if Jeſus Chriſt had remain'd on Earth, he could not have been a perfect and compleat High-Prieſt; if all his Work as a Prieſt had ended in what he did on Earth, his Office had not been
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:41523:188"/>conſummated; for it was neceſſary that he ſhould go into Heaven, as the High-Prieſt under the Law did into the Holy of Holies. When he had obtained eternal Redemption for us here, it was requiſite that he ſhould enter there, in order to the applying of what he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How is it, that Chriſt ever lives to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion.</hi> So he is affirmed to be a Prieſt for ever; <hi>to be made after the power of an endleſs Life,</hi> Verſe 16. of this Chapter. As <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> as Type of him, in a much inferior Senſe, is ſaid <hi>to abide a Priest continually,</hi> ver. 3.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Christ Interecedes conſtantly, without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> He does not, as the High Prieſt did it, once a Year, but always. He ſpent whole Nights ſometimes in Prayer, while he was in this World, but yet it was not his perpetual Work, as now it is. He intercedes Year after Year, and is never ſilent on our behalf, ſo much as for a moment. As he does not ceaſe to live at any time, ſo he does not ceaſe to Mediate with God for us. There never is any demurr or ſtop put to it; he never tires or faulters in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is not probable that the Interceſſion of Chriſt ſhould totally end, at the end of the World, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it will continue to all Eternity.</hi> In ſome reſpects indeed, there will be no occaſion or neceſſity for Chriſt's interceding after the laſt Judgment, to need of interceding for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Calling of any of the Elect, nor for the pardon of Sin, nor Progreſs in Sanctification, nor for the bringing of God's Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Glory; all thoſe things will be then actually done, and fully brought to paſs; but
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:41523:188"/>the Interceſſion of Chriſt will be ſtill needful for the everlaſting continuance of the Glorified in their Holy and Happy State. If the Vertue of the Blood of Chriſt could ever be ſpent, or its Voice drown'd, throughout Eternal Ages, what Security would Saints have for their Abode in Heaven?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Wherein is Chriſt's infinite Ability to Save evidenc'd hereby?</hi> Anſw. Abundantly; becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He perfectly underſtands every Caſe which be takes upon him to manage.</hi> He is not ignorant of any of our Matters, but is acquainted with them all, and does not need our poor defective Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of them to him. He knows what the Condition of our Souls requires, much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we do our ſelves; ſo that we may hope for a Supply of our unmentioned Wants, as well as others. His infinite Knowledge of our needy miſerable State, is an encouraging Token of his ſaving Power; for ſuch Perfections always go together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He hath a great Intereſt in the Father, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes with him according to his Will.</hi> He is God's Beloved Son, and they whom he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for, are beloved by the Father alſo. He is one that God rejoyced and delighted in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World, one that is as dear to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as himſelf; one that cannot ask, that God can refuſe or deny; for his Interceſſions are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways agreeable to the Divine Purpoſes, and he never craves any thing but what God hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly determined to grant. Every one would think himſelf ſafe and ſure enough of what he ſeeketh after, if he had ſuch a Favourite to be his Friend in any Earthly Court.</p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:41523:189"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt's Interceſſion does clearly evince the Validity and Entireneſs of his Satisfaction.</hi> God would not have admitted him to intercede, if he had not fully ſatisfied. His Interceſſion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the virtual Continuation of his Offering which he once made; and we cannot imagine that God ſhould ever give way to this, if that had not been a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to him. It is becauſe he paid our Debt as our Surety, that he is accepted to plead the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as our Attorney <hi>(Charnock.)</hi> It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is our Propitations, that he is alſo our Advocate. He failed not in the firſt of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and therefore with God's Approbation entred upon the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Christ is always heard in his Interceſſion, and carries every Cauſe hie Pleads.</hi> His Heart's deſire is always <hi>given him, and the request of his Lips</hi> is not with-held from him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 21.2. Never was any Supplicant ſo univerſally Succeſsful, as this mediator is. He, as a Prince indeed, hath Power with God, and prevails, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one Miſcarriage would be enough to damp us; but when all that he does, proſpers, what ſhould we fear? The Altar of Incenſe, which ſignified the Interceſſion of Chriſt, as well as the Altar of Burnt-Offering, which was a ſhadow of his Sacrifice, had Horns by God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the four Corners, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.2. with 27.2. to note that ſtrength of Salvation which Sinners have to flee to, and take hold of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Objects of Chriſts Interceſſion, or Perſons for whom he lives to intercede.</hi> Who are they? The Text directs to the Anſwer; <hi>For them that come unto God by him.</hi> Here we ſhould ſhew, What it is to come unto God by Chriſt, and how
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:41523:189"/>we are to underſtand that Chriſt makes Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for ſuch.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt. What it is to come to God by Chriſt?</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to God in the New Teſtament, is put eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis expreſſive of believing;</hi> John 6.35. <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me,</hi> &amp;c. The latter Clauſe does without all Controverſy, expound and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the former. Unbelief is ſet forth by the contrary; <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 40. <hi>You will not come to me,</hi> &amp;c. In this ſenſe there is no coming to God, but by Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> no believing in him but by Chriſt. The Sinner muſt go out of himſelf, as having nothing of his own to recommend him, or bring along with him, expecting Salvation from God meerly and ſolely on the behalf of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis expreſſive of all the ſolemn Acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip:</hi> Hebr. 11.6. <hi>He that cometh to God, muſt believe,</hi> &amp;c. The whole Service of God is to be perform'd under the influence of Faith, and this Faith muſt have a reſpect to Chriſt, and be exerciſed upon him. God is not acceſſible in any Duty, any other way. Whatſoever we do, is to be done in his Name, and to have its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God upon his account. There is no Spiritual Sacrifice pleaſing to God, but what is offer'd up by Believers, through the hands of Chriſt; and there is none ſo offer'd up, but what muſt needs be pleaſing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How are we to underſtand, that Chriſt makes Interceſſion for ſuch?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He intercedes for them excluſively:</hi> For them and no others, they that are final Deſpiſers and Rejecters of Chriſt, and pretend to go to God
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:41523:190"/>in the Old Way of the Firſt Covenant, or any New Invented Ways of their own (which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have a ſtrong Tincture of that in them) are ſuch as Jeſus Chriſt hath nothing to do with, and is not concerned about. All that he lives in Heaven to make Interceſſion for, are taught in due time, to make application <hi>to God by him;</hi> renouncing all other Grounds of Hope and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence whatſoever. His Interceſſion is limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſtrained to ſuch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He intercedes for them, and every one of them particularly. He calleth his own Sheep by Name, John</hi> 10.3. and diſtinctly remembers 'em all, with their ſeveral reſpective Caſes, of which no two in the World are ſtrictly and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alike; tho they do agree in many things, yet in other things they vary. Now Jeſus Chriſt does not remember one, and forget another; nor does his Interceſſion run upon Generals on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if he did no more than commend his whole Myſtical Body to God, but he takes notice of every part. <hi>I have prayed for thee Peter, Luke</hi> 22.32. So he does now for you and me, and all that commit themſelves to him; not only <hi>Sheep,</hi> but <hi>Lambs,</hi> not only <hi>ſtrong</hi> but <hi>weak</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; not only thoſe that are worthy of greateſt Honour, but ſuch as are leaſt eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What a woful condition are legal Worſhippers in, who ſtill adhere to Rites and Ceremonies which cannot ſave them?</hi> The Law having a Shadow of good things to come, and not the very Image (or Subſtance) of the things, can never with thoſe
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:41523:190"/>Sacrifices <hi>which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect,</hi> Hebr. 10.1. When their Conſtitution was moſt flouriſhing, and all thoſe external Appointments were kept up to their very height, they had not an High-Prieſt that ever lived to intercede for them, but were obliged to the Mediation of Chriſt; and now they have no Sacrifices, nor Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to carry the Blood of the Sacrifice into, thoſe weak and feeble Grounds of Carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence are quite taken away: <hi>Moſes,</hi> in whom they truſt, and whoſe Rules they pretend to follow, will be their Accuſer, inſtead of being their Advocate, as <hi>Elias made Interceſſion againſt Iſrael,</hi> not for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What a vile Reproach do they cast upon Christ, that employ and make uſe of other Interceſſors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him!</hi> The Apoſtle argues Chriſt's Power to ſave, from his living to Intercede; they who advance and prefer others to this Work, do really charge him with Inſufficiency. Hath he trode the Wine-Preſs alone, and is he not able to perform this buſineſs of Advocacy alone? Did he redeem us by himſelf, and muſt he have Partners in his Pleading Work? The firſt was rather more difficult than this laſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he muſt be aſſiſted in this, we may with more reaſon ſuſpect his needing of help as to the other; and conſequently we may doubt, whether he himſelf can be the Author of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation to us. So that the Antichriſtian Doctrine, of multiplied Mediators between God and us, tends to ſubvert our Faith, and opens the door to Infidelity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>We may learn hence, that Jeſus Christ, tho' taken from us, and made higher than the Heavens,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:41523:191"/>is not the leſs mindful of us, or leſs compaſſionate towards us.</hi> When the chief Butler was reſtor'd to his Place, he forgat poor <hi>Joſeph</hi> in Priſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40. <hi>ult.</hi> but Chriſt's Care and Affection is not leſſened by his Exaltation. He hath a more tender regard to our Infirmities, than any of our Fellow Creatures that are ſtill in Fleſh, can have; as the Brain (where all the Nerves, which are the Inſtruments of Sence, are terminated) is the chief Seat of all Perception, ſo the Myſtical Body, though one Member may feel the Wrong done to another, yet the Head is moſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of it. He hath left the World indeed, but is as ſollicitous as ever for them that are left behind. <hi>John</hi> 17.11. <hi>Now I am no more in the World, but theſe are in the World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Our daily renewed Guilt, though Ground of humble Walking, ought not to deſtroy our Comfort, or be matter of Diſcouragement.</hi> Chriſt's Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would not be continued, if there were not continual need of it. Some Men weary the Kindneſs of their Friends, by plunging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over and over in freſh Diſſiculties; and ſo they muſt be delivered again and again; as <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.19. This is not irkſom or uneaſy to Chriſt; for though we are every moment Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending one way or other, he does not leave off Interceding; <hi>For if any man ſin, we have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. 1 John 2.1.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Preſervation of thoſe that are in Chriſt, is very much owing to the Interceſſion of Christ for them.</hi> If we receive any Advantage by the Prayers of one another, how much more by his? What a helpleſs and hopeleſs Condition ſhould we ſoon be in, if our Lord Jeſus did not confirm
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:41523:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>his Love towards us, by praying the Father for us! Our ſtanding in the Grace of God, is a Fruit of his ſitting at the right Hand of God. So ſome interpret, <hi>the Life of Jeſus being made manifest in our mortal Body,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.10, 11. <hi>q. d.</hi> We are ſupported to go through ſuch Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and Tryals by the mighty Influence of our Living Saviour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Let this embolden us to ask in Faith, and quicken us to Pray with greater aſſurance:</hi> Having ſuch an High-Prieſt, to introduce us to God, we may comfortably plead the Cauſes of our Souls before him. The Prayers of Saints go up as a Memorial and ſweet Perfume, by reaſon of the Incenſe that Chriſt offers with them. <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee,</hi> is the Father's Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to the Son, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.8. as if he were to fetch out the Grace and Bleſſing of the Promiſe by Prayer. And the ſame terms are propoſed to us, <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you,</hi> Matth. 7.7. What can we have more? Yea, Chriſt himſelf will ſee it done, whatever is ask'd in his Name; he hath ſaid it twice, <hi>I will ſee it done,</hi> Matth. 14.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Let this be a Motive to us to live to Chriſt, and plead for him as we can, while we are here in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us live to Chriſt;</hi> who thought it not enough (as Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> ſays) to loſe one Life for us on Earth, but he alſo improves another in Heaven for us. What can we do leſs, then take <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Motto,</hi> and make it our daily Rule, <hi>To me to live is Christ?</hi> Phil. 1.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us plead for Christ;</hi> with God and with Men.</p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:41523:192"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>With God.</hi> While he intercedes for us, let us pray for him, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the Proſperity of his Concerns here in his lower Kingdom. This is to be done-continually, and without ceaſing, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72.15. as the Prophet is our Example, <hi>For Zion's ſake I will not hold my peace, and for Jeruſalem's ſake I will not reſt,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 62.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>With Men.</hi> Chriſt's Interceſſion on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half in Glory, will ſhamefully upbraid our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Silence, if we can quietly ſuffer his Name to be Blaſphemed, and his Goſpel ſcoffed out of the World. Their Confeſſion of Chriſt is no better than a Denial, that have nothing to ſay for him in ſuch a Caſe. The Spirit of Chriſt is his great Advocate here in the World; and therefore if we walk in that Spirit, Chriſt's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt will be duly regarded by us.</p>
